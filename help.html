<h3>Numbers</h3>

<p>
Numbers take the standard integer or floating point form or exponential form such as 123, -2.567, 1e+100, 3E-45 or -1.521e22.
Keep in mind that "e" is the Euler"s number constant $e$ and if you are trying to enter 2 times $e$ plus 22 then do not write it all together
as "2e+22" as this will be interpreted to be 2 * 10^22, use spaces and/or explicit multiplication: 2 * e + 22.
</p>

<h3>Variables</h3>

<p>
Variable names mostly follow LaTeX convention. With the exception of $i$, the imaginary unit and $e$ which is Euler"s number, variables
are single letters: $x, y, z, A, B$. Variables may also be greek letters preceded by a backslash such as "\alpha" ($\alpha$),
"\beta" ($\beta$), etc... again with exception of "\pi", which of course is the mathematical constant $\pi$. There are two special case constants
which are parsed as two letter constants without a slash since they are commonly used, those are "pi" without the slash, and "oo" which is infinity.
Infinity may also be entered as "\infty".
</p><p>
Variable names may be followed by various primes ' such as " a' " ($a'$) or " \omega'' " ($\omega''$).
Variables may be subscripted with other variables or numbers "x_1" ($x_1$), "y_z" ($y_z$), "\alpha_\omega" ($\alpha_\omega$).
This can be extended to silly levels " \gamma_{x_{y_0'}''}''' " ($\gamma_{x_{y_0'}''}'''$).
</p>

<h3>Parentheses</h3>

<p>
Explicit '()' or implicit curly '{}' parentheses allow prioritization of lower precedence operations over higher order ones as usual. They may be
used interchangeably, the only difference being that the implicit version is not drawn if it does not need to be.
</p>

<h3>Addition and Multiplication</h3>
Addition is addition and subtraction is subtraction: "a + b", "a - b". Multiplication is explicit with a "*" operator or implicit simply by writing
two symbols next to each other so that "a * b" is the same as "ab". There is however a difference between the two in that the implicit version
has a higher precedence than the explicit, which means that explicit multiplication will end a limit, sum, differential or division expression whereas
implicit will not, e.g. "1/xy" = $\frac{1}{xy}$ whereas "1/x*y" = $\frac{1}{x} \cdot y$.
</p><p>
Division also has two operators, the normal "/" which has a fairly low precedence and the LaTeX "\frac" version which has a very high precedence, even
higher than exponentiation. So high in fact that parentheses are not needed if using "\frac" as an exponent as in "x^\frac{1}{2}" = $x^\frac{1}{2}$.
The "\frac" operation also does not need parentheses if using single digit operands or single letter variables (latin or greek) such as "\frac12" =
$\frac12$, "\frac\alpha\beta" = $\frac\alpha\beta$ or "\fracxy" = $\frac xy$ (although this last version without a space before the x is not legal in
standard LaTeX).
</p>

<h3>Exponentiation</h3>

<p>
There are two power opearators "^" and "**". They have the same precedence and can be used interchangeably but follow slightly different parsing
rules. The "^" operator follows LaTeX rules which only allow a single positive digit or letter (lating or greek) variable without the use of curly
braces whereas the "**" follows Python rules which allow negative values or variables or functions. To illustrate the diffference: "x**-2" = $x^{-2}$
whereas "x^-2" = $x^-2$ (which makes no sense). Also, "e**log(x)" will work as expected ($e^{\log(x)}$) whereas "e^log(x)" = $e^log(x)$.
</p>

<h3>Logarithms</h3>

<p>
The natural logarithm of x is specified "lnx", "\ln x", "log x", "\log{x}". A logarithm in a specific base is specified by "\log_b x" ($\log_b x$),
"log_{10}(x)" ($\log_{10} {x}$), etc...
</p>

<h3>Roots</h3>

<p>
The square root of x ($\sqrt{x}$) may be entered in any of these forms "sqrtx", "\sqrt x", "sqrt (x)", "\sqrt{x}", with or without the backslash.
The cube (or any other) root is similar, ($\sqrt[3]x$) = "sqrt[3]x", "sqrt[3] (x)", "\sqrt[3] {x}".
</p>

<h3>Functions</h3>

<p>
Currently several single parameter functions are supported directly, with a mechanism for calling any other existing single parameter SymPy function
explicitly. The standard trigonometric and hyperbolic functions and their inverses can be entered as usual, with or without leading backslash:
"sin", "acos", "arctan", "\acosh", etc... In addition these functions accept a special standard syntax for exponentiation or inverses as a convenience.
For example "sin^2(x)" = $\sin^2(x)$ and "\tan^{-1}x" = $\arctan(x)$.
</p><p>
Other SymPy functions are supported directly such as "simplify (sin(x) / cos(x))" = $\tan(x)$, "expand ({x+1}^3)" = $x^3+3x^2+3x+1$ and
"factor (x^2 + 2x + 1)" = $(x+1)^2$. Functions don't technically REQUIRE explicit or implicit parentheses but for any parameter more complicated
than another function or variable to a power they will be needed.
</p><p>
Three functions have a special separate syntax. The function "abs (x)" is equivalent to the standard bar syntax for absolute value "|x|", the
"factorial (x)" function is identical to writing "x!" and "exp (x)" is the same as writing "e^x". In fact those functions are translated on the fly.
</p><p>
If a function is not supported directly (and most are not) then it can still be called using a special escape characted "\($\)". To call the
SymPy "sign" function for example simply enter "\($\)sign (-2)".
</p><p>
The last special function is "?", this is equivalent to SymPy "N ()" or "evalf ()" and it will ask SymPy to numerically evaluate whatever it can
in the given expression. This is how you would get the numerical value of $\sqrt 2$ or $\sin(2)$.
</p>

<h3>Limits</h3>

<p>
To take the limit of an expression "z" as variable "x" approaches "y" enter "\lim_{x \to y} (z)" ($\lim_{x\to y} (z)$). This will only give the limit
if it exists and is the same when approaching from both directions, unlike SymPy which defaults to approaching from the positive direction. To specify
a direction add "^+" or "^-" to the equation as such: "\lim_{x \to y^+} (z)" ($\lim_{x\to y^+} (z)$).
</p>

<h3>Sums</h3>

<h3>Differentiation</h3>

<h3>Integration</h3>

<h3>Interface</h3>

<p>
Input history is supported with the up and down arrows.
</p><p>
The symbolic expressions can be copied to the clipboard in various formats. Single click for a simple short format meant to be pasted back into the
input field. A double click copies the expression in Python format suitable for pasting into a Python shell or source file. Note in this case that
"e" is copied as "e" and not the SymPy "E", "i" is copied as "i" and not "I" or "1j". Simply set "e = E" and "i = I" or "i = 1j" in the Python context
depending on need. Finally a triple click will copy the expression in LaTeX format. The simple and LaTeX formats should be directly pasteable into
SymPy whereas the Python representation may or may not be depending on what elements it includes.
</p><p>
There is a special use for the "_" character which has the same meaning as in the Python interactive shell in that it represents the last
expression successfully evaluated. To see this in action type in "1" and hit Enter, then put in "expand ((x+1)*_)" and hit Enter. Repeat this
several times using the up arrow. This character may not want to follow directly after an alphanumeric character since it is also used to
subscript variables, in this case simply precede it with a space.
