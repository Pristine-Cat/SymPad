<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>
SymPad is a simple single script graphical symbolic calculator / scratchpad using SymPy for the math, MathJax for the display in a browser and matplotlib for plotting.
It is a labor of love and grew out of a desire for an easy way to calculate a quick integral while studying some math without having to start a shell every time and import a package or fire up a browser and navigate to a site (technincally that last bit is exactly what happens but the response time is better :)
This desire for simplicity led to the single script option "sympad.py" which I could plop down on the desktop and execute when needed.
User input is intended to be quick, easy and intuitive and is displayed in symbolic form as it is being entered.
Sympad will accept Python expressions, LaTeX formatting, Unicode math symbols and a native shorthand intended for fast entry, or a mix of all of these.
The input will be evaluated symbolically or numerically with the results being copy/pasteable in Python or LaTeX formats, so it acts as a translator as well.

<h2 id="Quick Start">Quick Start</h2>

<p>
The best way to see what SymPad can do is by doing, so try entering any of the following into SymPad:
</p><p>
cos**-1 0 \log_2 8<br>
expand ((1 + x)**4)<br>
factor (x^3 + 3y x^2 + 3x y^2 + y^3)<br>
series (e^x, x, 0, 5)<br>
Limit (\frac1x, x, 0, dir='-')<br>
\sum_{n=0}**oo x^n / n!<br>
d**6 / dx dy**2 dz**3 x^3 y^3 z^3<br>
Integral (e^{-x^2}, (x, 0, \infty))<br>
\int_0^\pi \int_0^{2pi} \int_0^1 rho**2 sin\phi drho dtheta dphi<br>
\[[1, 2], [3, 4]]**-1<br>
Matrix (4, 4, lambda r, c: c + r if c &gt; r else 0)<br>
(({1, 2, 3} && {2, 3, 4}) ^^ {3, 4, 5}) - \{4} || {7,}<br>
f (x, y) = sqrt (x**2 + y**2)<br>
solve (x**2 + y = 4, x)<br>
dsolve (y(x)'' + 9y(x))<br>
y = y(t); dsolve (y'' - 4y' - 12y = 3e**{5t})<br>
plotf (2pi, -2, 2, sin x, 'r=sin', cos x, 'g=cos', tan x, 'b=tan')<br>
</p>

<h4 id="Multiline Examples">Multiline Examples</h4>

<p>
Enter the lines that follow one by one to see the effect:
</p><p>
1<br>
expand (_(x+1))<br>
expand (_(x+1))<i>&emsp;**(or press the up arrow)</i><br>
expand (_(x+1))<i>&emsp;...</i><br>
</p><p>
Or the following:
</p><p>
a, b = 1, 1<br>
a, b = b, a + b<br>
a, b = b, a + b<i>&emsp;**(or press the up arrow)</i><br>
a, b = b, a + b<i>&emsp;...</i><br>
</p><p>
Automatic variable substitution:
</p><p>
y = x**2 + 2x + 1<br>
y<br>
x = 2<br>
y<br>
del x<br>
y<br>
</p>

<p>
For more examples see <a href="#More Examples">More Examples</a>.
</p>

<h4 id="Usage">Usage</h4>

<p>
You enter expresstions and they get evaluated.
The expressions may be in normal Pythonic style like "<b>a * (b + sin (x)**2 + 3/4) / 2</b>", LaTeX such as "<b>a\frac{b+\sin^2{x}+\frac34}{2}</b>" or a mix "<b>a * (b + \sin**2{x} + \frac34) / 2</b>".
The input is displayed symbolically as you type.
Input history is supported with the up and down arrows.
SymPad will give some limited options for autocompletion for certain expressions sometimes, this mostly means that you will not have to close parentheses.
</p><p>
The symbolic expressions can be copied to the clipboard in various formats.
Single-click for a simple native format meant to be pasted back into the input field.
A double click-copies the expression in Python format suitable for pasting into a Python shell or source file.
Finally, a triple-click will copy the expression in LaTeX format.
The single-click native and double-click Python formats should almost always be pasteable back into SymPad, whereas the LaTeX format may or may not be depending on what elements are present.
</p>

<h4 id="Quick Input Mode">Quick Input Mode</h4>

<p>
This is the input mode SymPad was born in and still my preferred mode for quick calculations due to the ease and speed of input.
SymPad normally allows long variable names, requires spaces between them for implicit multiplication and enforces grammatical breaks between function names and variables.
This can be turned off by switching into quick input mode using the function "<b>env(quick)</b>" or by using the "<b>--quick</b>" option on the command line.
When in this mode long variable names are sacrificed for quicker input of single letter variables (Latin or Greek - with or without leading slash) and explicit space characters are no longer necessary between variables and recognized function names, though they are required AFTER function names.
This means that an expression entered in normal mode like this "<b>x y z sin w**2</b>" can be entered in quick mode like this "<b>xyzsin w**2</b>".
Note that a grammatical break is also still required AFTER text operators like "<b>if</b>", "<b>else</b>", "<b>in</b>", "<b>not in</b>", etc... otherwise they would make too many functions inaccessible by being recognized as part of a word.
For convenience certain multi-character variables are accepted in quick mode - Greek letters (including "<b>pi</b>"), "<b>oo</b>" for infinity and "<b>zoo</b>" for complex infinity, "<b>partial</b>", "<b>True</b>", "<b>False</b>" and "<b>None</b>".
</p>

<h2 id="Types">Types</h2>

<h4 id="Numbers">Numbers</h4>

<p>
Numbers take the standard integer or floating point form or exponential form such as 123, -2.567, 1e+100, 3E-45 or -1.521e22.
The precision for all SymPy Floats used in evaluation is set to the highest precision number present in the equation or referenced variables, so if you ask for the cosine of a number with 50 decimal digits your answer will have at least 50 decimal digits (where SymPy respects this).
</p><p>
Keep in mind that "<b>e</b>" or "<b>E</b>" is the Euler"s number constant $e$ and if you are trying to enter 2 times $e$ plus 22 then do not write it all together as "<b>2e+22</b>" as this will be interpreted to be "<b>2 * 10^22</b>".
Instead, use spaces and/or explicit multiplication: "<b>2 * e + 22</b>".
Imaginary numbers are entered using the imaginary unit "<b>i</b>" or "<b>I</b>" depending on preference, no Pythonic "<b>j</b>" option at the moment but it can be hacked by setting "<b>j = i</b>" in SymPad.
</p>

<h4 id="Booleans">Booleans</h4>

<p>
Your standard True and False with SymPy Boolean results being coerced to these.
SymPad modifies the SymPy Boolean classes to allow basic arithmetic so you can use the results of comparisons in expressions and they are automatically cast just like in Python to 1 and 0.
</p>

<h4 id="Vectors and Matrices">Vectors and Matrices</h4>

<p>
Vectors are passed as a single level of brackets such as "<b>\[1, 2]</b>" or "<b>\[x, y, z]</b>" and these are interpreted as column matrices.
Matrices are passed as nested rows of brackets with the first bracket being preceeded by a slash.
A 2x3 matrix would be specified as  "<b>\[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]</b>", a 1x3 would be "<b>\[[1, 2, 3]]</b>" and a 3x1 would be either "<b>\[[1], [2], [3]]</b>" or the easier to write "<b>\[1, 2, 3]</b>" since this is equivalent.
These can also be entered using LaTeX "<b>\<span></span>begin{(v|b|p|)matrix} \<span></span>end{(v|b|p|)matrix}</b>" format.
</p>

<h4 id="Piecewise Expressions">Piecewise Expressions</h4>

<p>
These are supported and can be entered as SymPy "<b>Piecewise</b>" functions, LaTeX "<b>\<span></span>begin{cases} \<span></span>end{cases}</b>" notation or the native Python-like conditional expressions of the form "<b>a if condition else b</b>".
They may be arbitrarily long - "<b>a if condition1 else b if condition2 else ...</b>" and may leave off the last "<b>else</b>" which is equivalent to a SymPy "<b>Piecewise</b>" function without a terminating "<b>True</b>" condition.
</p>

<h4 id="Functions Types">Fuctions</h4>

<p>
Apart from the top level SymPy functions which are available for calling but not as objects to be passed around or for assigning, there are two other types of function objects which can be manipulated in SymPad.
There are lambda functions which can be assigned expressions and executed in SymPad like normal SymPy functions, and even passed into Python code to be executed like normal Python lambdas.
There are also undefined mathematical function objects to be used mostly in differential equations.
These last two types are assigned and can be passed around in SymPy just like any other type, the details of their operations are discussed in the "<b>Functions</b>" section below.
</p>

<h4 id="Strings, Lists, Tuples and Dictionaries">Strings, Lists, Tuples and Dictionaries</h4>

<p>
These exist for the sole purpose of passing arguments to SymPy functions, not really to be operated on (though basic operations work).
Strings work as expected being enclosed by single or double quotes and supporting escape sequences, for example "<b>Limit (1/x, x, 0, '-')</b>".
Standard Python bracket enclosed lists and optionally parentheses enclosed tuples are accepted.
Like strings these exist for the purpose of passing parameters to functions like "<b>Matrix ([[1, 2], [3, 4]])</b>".
Standard Python dictionaries are entered using the same format as Python "<b>{a: b, c: d}</b>" and like strings, lists and tuples these exist for the purpose of passing and recieving parameters to and from functions.
</p>

<h4 id="Sets">Sets</h4>

<p>
These are not the standard Python sets but rather are represented internally by the SymPy object "<b>FiniteSet</b>".
They can be entered via said "<b>FiniteSet</b>" function or via standard Python syntax for sets containing more than one element like "<b>{a, b, c}</b>".
To enter a set of zero or one element use the slash-curly set override syntax to open the set as such "<b>\{1}</b>" or "<b>{1,}</b>" for a one-element set or "<b>\{}</b>" for the empty set, otherwise for one element the curlys would be interpreted as parentheses and just like in Python the "<b>{}</b>" string is an empty dictionary, not a set.
As said these are converted to "<b>FiniteSet</b>" for evaluation. If however you need a true Python set for some reason then wrap the set or any other iterable in the Python "<b>set()</b>" function, this will always result in a Python set inside the calculations, though it will be returned to SymPy as a "<b>FiniteSet</b>" after the calculation completes.
</p><p>
The following default sets are available at the top level: "<b>Complexes</b>", "<b>Reals</b>", "<b>Naturals</b>", "<b>Naturals0</b>" and "<b>Integers</b>".
</p>

<h4 id="Variables">Variables</h4>

<p>
Variable names can be a mix of Python and LaTeX format, they can be multi-character but cannot start with an underscore "<b>_</b>" or a number though they may contain those.
Standard identifiers are accepted as well as single Greek letters optionally preceded by a slash such as "<b>\alpha</b>" ($\alpha$), "<b>epsilon</b>" ($\epsilon$) or "<b>\Psi</b>" ($\Psi$).
The Greek letters recognized and rendered in ... Greek ... are only those normally present within LaTeX which can not be visually confused with Latin letters, those Greek letters are accepted in Unicode as well.
</p><p>
The variable names "<b>i</b>", "<b>e</b>" and "<b>\pi</b>" represent their respective mathematical constants $i$, $e$ and $\pi$.
"<b>pi</b>" and "<b>oo</b>" are also available for $\pi$ and $\infty$.
Python's "<b>None</b>", "<b>True</b>" and "<b>False</b>" are also present.
By default, the lowercase "<b>e</b>" and "<b>i</b>" letters are used to represent Euler's number and the imaginary unit instead of the default SymPy uppercase "<b>E</b>" and "<b>I</b>".
This is objectively prettier, but can be changed via the "<b>env (EI)</b>" and "<b>env (noEI)</b>" function.
The SymPy constant usage can also be activated via the command line switch "<b>--EI</b>".
</p><p>
Differentials are entered as "<b>dx</b>", "<b>partialx</b>", "<b>\partialx</b>", "<b>\partial x</b>" or "<b>∂x</b>" and are treated as a single variable.
If you want to enter "<b>d</b>" * "<b>x</b>" multiplied implicitly then put a space between them or two spaces between the "<b>\partial</b>" and the "<b>x</b>".
There is nothing special about differential variables other than their specific use in differentiation and integration.
</p><p>
Variables may be assigned values, references to other variables or even entire expressions which will subsequently be substituted for those variables in any future expression evaluation.
When variable assignments exist then any instance of that variable used almost anywhere will be replaced with the value of the variable, this can lead to errors if you forgot a variable is assigned and try to use it as a free variable.
For example, when "<b>x</b>" is not assigned to anything then "<b>series (e**x, x, 0, 5)</b>" will give the correct answer, but set "<b>x = 1</b>" and all of a sudden you have a different result, set it to 2 and you have an error.
</p>

<h2 id="Operations">Operations</h2>

<h4 id="Addition and Multiplication">Addition and Multiplication</h4>

<p>
Addition is addition and subtraction is subtraction: "<b>a + b</b>", "<b>a - b</b>".
Multiplication is explicit with a "<b>*</b>" operator or implicit simply by writing two symbols next to each other with a space in between so that "<b>a * b</b>" is the same as "<b>a b</b>".
There is however a difference between the two in that the implicit version has a higher precedence than the explicit, which means that explicit multiplication will end a limit, sum, derivative or division "<b>/</b>" expression whereas implicit multiplication will not, e.g. "<b>1/x y</b>" = $\frac{1}{x y}$ whereas "<b>1/x*y</b>" = $\frac{1}{x} \cdot y$.
</p><p>
Division also has two operators, the normal "<b>/</b>" which has a fairly low precedence and the LaTeX "<b>\frac</b>" version which has a very high precedence, even higher than exponentiation.
So high in fact that parentheses are not needed if using "<b>\frac</b>" as an exponent as in "<b>x^\frac{1}{2}</b>" = $x^\frac{1}{2}$.
The "<b>\frac</b>" operation also does not need parentheses if using single digit operands or single letter variables (Latin or Greek) such as "<b>\frac12</b>" = $\frac12$ or "<b>\frac\alpha\beta</b>" = $\frac\alpha\beta$.
</p>

<h4 id="Exponentiation">Exponentiation</h4>

<p>
There are two power opearators "<b>^</b>" and "<b>**</b>". They have the same precedence and can be used interchangeably but follow slightly different
parsing rules. The "<b>^</b>" operator follows LaTeX rules which only allow a single positive digit or letter variable (Lating or Greek) without the use
of curly braces whereas the "<b>**</b>" follows Python rules which allow negative values or variables or functions. To illustrate the diffference:
"<b>x**-2</b>" = $x^{-2}$ whereas "<b>x^-2</b>" = $x^-2$ (which makes no sense). Also, "<b>e**ln(x)</b>" will work as expected $e^{\ln(x)}$ whereas
"<b>e^ln(x)</b>" = $e^ln(x)$.
</p>

<h4 id="Logarithms">Logarithms</h4>

<p>
The natural logarithm of x is specified by "<b>ln x</b>", "<b>\ln x</b>", "<b>log x</b>", "<b>\log{x}</b>". A logarithm in a specific base is specified
by "<b>\log_b x</b>" = $\log_b x$, "<b>\log_{10}(1000)</b>" = $\log_{10}{1000}$ = 3, etc...
</p>

<h4 id="Roots">Roots</h4>

<p>
The square root of x ($\sqrt{x}$) may be entered in any of these forms "<b>sqrt x</b>", "<b>\sqrt x</b>", "<b>sqrt (x)</b>", "<b>\sqrt{x}</b>", with or without the slash.
The cube (or any other) root is similar, $\sqrt[3]x$ = "<b>sqrt[3]x</b>", "<b>sqrt[3] (x)</b>" or "<b>\sqrt[3] {x}</b>".
</p>

<h4 id="Factorial">Factorial</h4>

<p>
"<b>4!</b>" = "<b>24</b>", "<b>x!</b>" = "<b>factorial(x)</b>", "<b>(-0.5)!</b>" = "<b>1.77245385090552</b>" and "<b>simplify(x!/x)</b>" = "<b>gamma(x)</b>".
</p>

<h4 id="Absolute Value">Absolute Value</h4>

<p>
The shorthand for the absolute value of "<b>x</b>" is "<b>|x|</b>" though this may be ambiguous if using multiple absolute value bars, in which case simply wrap it in curly braces or parentheses as such "<b>{|x|}</b>".
</p>

<h4 id="Limits">Limits</h4>

<p>
To take the limit of an expression "<b>z</b>" as variable "<b>x</b>" approaches "<b>y</b>" enter "<b>\lim_{x \to y} (z)</b>" = $\lim_{x\to y} (z)$.
This will only give the limit if it exists and is the same when approaching from both directions, unlike SymPy which defaults to approaching from the
positive direction. To specify a direction add "<b>^+</b>" or "<b>^-</b>" to the equation as such: "<b>\lim_{x \to 0^+} 1/x</b>" = $\lim_{x\to 0^+}
\frac1x$ = $\infty$ and "<b>\lim_{x \to 0^-} 1/x</b>" = $\lim_{x\to 0^-} \frac1x$ = $-\infty$. Addition and explicit multiplication terminate a limit
expression. Limits may also be entered using the standard SymPy syntax "<b>Limit (expression, variable, to)</b>", this defaults to limit from positive
direction like SymPy, or you may specify a direction "<b>Limit (expression, variable, to, dir='+-')</b>".
</p>

<h4 id="Sums">Sums</h4>

<p>
The summation (finite or infinite) of expression "<b>z</b>" as variable "<b>n</b>" ranges from "<b>a</b>" to "<b>b</b>" is written as "<b>\sum_{n=a}^b
(z)</b>" = $\sum_{n=a}^b (z)$. Iterated sums work as expected, "<b>\sum_{n=1}^3 \sum_{m=1}^n m</b>" = $\sum_{n=1}^3 \sum_{m=1}^n m$ = 10. Addition and
explicit multiplication terminate a sum expression.
Sums may also be entered using the standard SymPy syntax "<b>Sum (expression, (variable, from, to))</b>".
</p>

<h4 id="Differentiation">Differentiation</h4>

<p>
The derivative of expression "<b>z</b>" with respect to "<b>x</b>" is entered as "<b>d/dx z</b>" or "<b>\frac{d}{dx} z</b>" = $\frac{d}{dx} z$.
The second derivative is "<b>d^2/dx^2 (z)</b>" or "<b>\frac{d^2}{dx^2} (z)</b>" = $\frac{d^2}{dx^2} (z)$. Using "<b>\partial</b>" ($\partial$) is allowed but must be consistent within the expression.
Mixed derivatives are entered as "<b>d^2 / dx dy (z)</b>" or "<b>\partial^2 / \partial x\partial y (z)</b>" = $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x\partial y} (z)$.
Derivatives may also be entered using any of the standard SymPy syntaxes like "<b>Derivative (expression, var1, var2, power2, ...)</b>".
Derivatives can also be specified using prime notation if the given expression has exactly one free variable to derivate, line "<b> sin (x)' </b>" or "<b> (x**3)'' </b>".
Standard $\frac{dy}{dx}$ and $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}$ forms are also accepted as "<b>dy/dx</b>" and "<b>d**2y/dx**2</b>" and if the variable "<b>y</b>" contains an expression or lambda function then that will be differentiated.
</p>

<h4 id="Integration">Integration</h4>

<p>
The anti-derivative of expression "<b>z</b>" with respect to x is written as "<b>\int z dx</b>" = $\int z\ dx$. The definite integral from "<b>a</b>" to
"<b>b</b>" is "<b>\int_a^b z dx</b>" = $\int_a^b z\ dx$. "<b>\int dx/x</b>" = $\int \frac1x\ dx$. Iterated and improper integrals also work. Integrals
may also be entered using the standard SymPy syntax "<b>Integral (expression, (variable, from, to), ...)</b>".
</p>

<h4 id="Logic Operations">Logic Operations</h4>

<p>
The standard Python "<b>or</b>", "<b>and</b>" and "<b>not</b>" operations are present but they are implemented using SymPy "<b>Or</b>", "<b>And</b>" and "<b>Not</b>" objects.
Though by default these objects work only on booleans and not things like lists or tuples or other objects, SymPad makes them work by coercing any objects which they do not accept to booleans.
</p>

<h4 id="Comparison">Comparison</h4>

<p>
Are parsed from the standard Python "<b>=, ==, !=, &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=</b>", LaTeX "<b>\ne, \neq, \lt, \le, \gt, \ge</b>" and also Unicode "<b>≠, ≤, ≥, ∈, ∉</b>" symbols.
Extended multiple argument comparison is supported like in Python "<b>x &lt; y &lt; z</b>", though it is not natively supported by SymPy, SymPad works around this by converting these to "<b>And</b>" expressions of multiple infividual comparisons.
Note that the "<b>=</b>" and "<b>==</b>" operators are equivalent for SymPy and mapped to the same "<b>Eq</b>" object in expressions but the single "<b>=</b>" operator has a lower precedence than the others and is used by SymPad for variable assignment whereas the double "<b>==</b>" only ever implies comparison.
Also, although SymPad can generally infer the meaning of the single "<b>=</b>" whether it is an assignment, a keyword argument to a function or an equation, to be absolutely sure that an equation is treated as such use the double "<b>==</b>" operator.
</p><p>
The membership test "<b>in</b>" and "<b>not in</b>" are related to the comparison operators in that they generate a boolean value and just like in Python they live on the same precedence level.
These may be entered like in Python, using the LaTeX versions "<b>\in</b>" and "<b>\notin</b>" or directly using the Unicode characters "<b>∈</b>" and "<b>∉</b>" and they test for membership in any sequence or iterable.
</p>

<h4 id="Set Operations">Set Operations</h4>

<p>
These basic set operations are supported: "<b>+</b>", "<b>||</b>", "<b>\cup</b>" or "<b>∪</b>" for union - "<b>{1, 2} || {2, 3} = {1, 2, 3}</b>".
"<b>&&</b>", "<b>\cap</b>" or "<b>∩</b>" for intersection - "<b>{1, 2} && {2, 3} = {2,}</b>".
"<b>^^</b>", "<b>\ominus</b>" or "<b>⊖</b>" for symmetric difference - "<b>{1, 2} ^^ {2, 3} = {1, 3}</b>".
"<b>-</b>" for relative complement - "<b>{1, 2} - {2, 3} = {1,}</b>".
The comparison operators can be applied to sets to test for subset "<b>&lt;</b>", proper subset "<b>&lt;=</b>", superset "<b>&gt;</b>" or proper superset "<b>&gt;=</b>".
The membership test operators "<b>in</b>" and "<b>not in</b>" work on sets as expected.
</p><p>
SymPy sets are a little broken in that the set operations will not accept undefined variables as stand-ins for sets to be evaluated later, which would mean that lambda functions using sets would not normally be possible.
A partial fix is to wrap the set operations in a lambda or variable assignment using the no-evaluate pseudo function like this "<b>f = lambda a, b: %(a || b)</b>", this will allow you to use the lambda but will still error out if you try to assign it to another
variable or view it.
</p>

<h4 id="Parentheses">Parentheses</h4>

<p>
Explicit "<b>( )</b>" or implicit curly "<b>{ }</b>" parentheses allow prioritization of lower precedence operations over higher ones as usual and also
delineate an expression as an input to a function. They may be used interchangeably for single expressions, the only difference being that the implicit
version is not drawn if it does not need to be. The case where explicit "<b>( )</b>" parentheses are needed ... explicitly ... is when calling functions
in general and always when calling functions which take multiple parameters like "<b>max(1, 2, 3)</b>". The curly braces are used as shorthand for sets
and dictionaries if commas are present, but that is a different syntactic usage, curlys with no commas are essentially invisible parentheses.
</p>

<h4 id="Indexing">Indexing</h4>

<p>
Python style bracket indexing is natively supported for all objects using single or tuple indices and slices - "<b>'Hello'[::-1]</b>" = "<b>'olleH'</b>", "<b>\[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]] [1, 2]</b>" = "<b>6</b>" and "<b>\[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]] [:, 1:]</b>" = "<b>\[[2, 3], [5, 6]]</b>".
</p>

<h4 id="Member Access">Member Access</h4>

<p>
You can access member data or functions of an expression just like in Python with the "<b>.</b>" operator.
If the attribute name following the dot is followed by a parenthesized expression then it will be treated as a function call instead of an implicit multiplication, otherwise it is a data member.
For example, two ways to get the transpose of a matrix are "<b>\[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]].T</b>" and "<b>\[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]].transpose ()</b>".
</p>

<h4 id="Variable Assignment">Variable Assignment</h4>

<p>
Using the syntax "<b>var = expression</b>" you can assign some value to be substituted for that variable in all expressions.
For example, doing "<b>x = pi</b>" and then evaluating "<b>cos x</b>" will give you "<b>-1</b>".
Anything can be assigned to any valid variable like mathematical expressions, Python objects like strings or lists, user lambda functions or even references to other variables.
To delete an assignment use the "<b>del var</b>" function or "<b>del (var1, var2, ...)</b>" to delete multiple variables, to delete all variables use "<b>delall()</b>".
To see what variables are currently assigned use the "<b>vars()</b>" function.
</p><p>
Tuple assignment is supported and as in Python the source can be another tuple or a single iterable object like "<b>x, y = 1, 2</b>".
A useless example of iterable assignment would be setting "<b> a, b, c = 'str' </b>" which would give you "<b> a = 's' </b>", "<b> b = 't' </b>" and "<b> c = 'r' </b>".
</p><p>
There are two distinct types of assignment that can occur and you should be aware of the difference between them.
Copy assignment is the standard type of assignment used by default in most computer languages where if you start with "<b>x = 1</b>" and you then enter "<b>y = x</b>" then the value "<b>1</b>" will be copied to the "<b>y</b>" variable.
The value of "<b>y</b>" will be independent of whatever else happens to the variable "<b>x</b>" after this.
</p><p>
The other kind of assignment is a reference assignment which will map the source variable instead of copying its value to the target.
This means that if you have a reference set like "<b>y = x</b>" and the value of "<b>x</b>" changes then the value of "<b>y</b>" will reflect this new value as well.
The reference assignment happens if you try to assign variables which do not exist, so setting "<b>y = x</b>" before "<b>x</b>" has been created will result in a reference.
Otherwise you can force a reference by using the "<b>@()</b>" pseudo-function.
Doing "<b>y = @x</b>" will create a reference to "<b>x</b>" itself instead of copying the value if it exists.
The "<b>@(expr)</b>" function technically prevents variable remapping for the expression it encompasses, so if you have the variable "<b>x = 2</b>" set and you do "<b>@(x)</b>" then you will get "<b>x</b>" and not "<b>2</b>".
</p><p>
Another potentially useful meta-function for assignment is "<b>%(expr)</b>".
This function defers evaluation of the expression for one round thus allowing things like assigning an integral operation to a variable instead of the result of the integral - "<b>f = %(\int a dx)</b>".
In this way you can assign different values to "<b>a</b>" and have the integration happen automatically any time you access the "<b>f</b>" variable instead of just using the result of whatever variables were defined at the time of definition.
</p>

<h4 id="Simplification">Simplification</h4>

<p>
Apart from the explicit simplification you can always do via the "<b>simplify()</b>" function, SymPad can try to automatically simplify the result of any calculation before returning it.
This can be useful due to the fact that many times SymPy prefers to return results quicker and leaves the option to simplify to the user - in this case SymPad, whereas SymPad is the kind of application which should always present the simplest possible representation of a result.
This behavior can be turned on by calling "<b>env('simplify')</b>" and turned back on via "<b>env(nosimplify)</b>", note the string quotes since "<b>simplify</b>" is a reserved SymPy function name.
</p><p>
A separate type of simplification is done for matrix operations since native SymPy matrix operations tend to blow up fairly quickly.
This simplification is on by default and simplifies matrices any time they are multiplied which helps control intermediate results in complex matrix operations and gives an already simplified answer once the operation completes.
This tends to slow down normal matrix operations a little but prevents the kind of lockup that can occur if a complex operation leaves a matrix in a state which is impossible for the normal "<b>simplify()</b>" function to correct.
This simplification can be turned off and on via "<b>env(nomatsimp)</b>" and "<b>env(matsimp)</b>".
</p>

<h2 id="Functions">Functions</h2>

<p>
There are two types of functions made available in SymPad - all the SymPy native functions are available directly just by typing their name (a few escaped with "<b>$</b>"), as well as user created lambda functions assigned to variables.
In addition, member functions of objects are supported and callable like "<b>Matrix ([1, 2, 3]).transpose ()</b>".
All functions may take multiple comma-separated arguments and the SymPy functions also optionally take keyword arguments.
</p>

<h4 id="SymPy Functions">SymPy Functions</h4>

<p>
Almost all SymPy function and objects from the top level of the SymPy module are made available directly for calling by their name like "<b>tan(x)</b>", the only restriction being they must be longer than a single character and may not begin with an underscore.
Though those functions and others beginning with an underscore as well as many __builtins__ can still be accessed with the "<b>$</b>" function override escape character, for example "<b>$print ("Hello World...")</b>".
Only the "safe" __builtin__ functions are specifically made available, functions like "<b>eval</b>", "<b>exec</b>" and many more have been left out and are not accessible.
The reason for excluding single letter functions is that due to the way the grammar works all natively recognized function names are permanently excluded from being used as variables and since very often single letters are used as variable names this would be problematic.
A workaround is in place and described further down.
</p><p>
The standard trigonometric and hyperbolic functions and their inverses can be entered as usual, the forward functions with or without a leading slash: "<b>sin</b>", "<b>\coth</b>".
The inverses are entered as Pythonic functions without a slash like "<b>atan</b>" or "<b>acscsh</b>" and the LaTeX versions take a slash and and are spelled out "<b>\arctan</b>".
The inverses may also be specified using the common mathematical syntax: "<b>\tan^{-1}x</b>" or "<b>cos**-1 x</b>".
This form of exponentiating a function is extended as an input shortcut for all top-level functions so that typing "<b>ln**2x</b>" is a quick way to enter "<b>(ln(x))**2</b>".
This does not apply to member functions or user created lambda functions.
Keep in mind that the "<b>-1</b>" exponent in those contexts is just a -1 and does not specify the inverse function as it does for the forward trigonometric and hyperbolic functions.
</p><p>
Top-level and user lambda functions also don't require explicit parentheses in order to allow quick entry like "<b>sqrt 2</b>" or "<b>sin**-1x</b>" but for any parameter more complicated than another function or variable to a power they will be needed.
Functions which take zero or more than one single parameter, as well as member functions such as "<b>\[[1, 1], [0, 1]].det()</b>" always require explicit parentheses.
Many functions which have a common mathematical display style are translated on the fly for rendering in that style.
These include the functions "<b>abs/Abs (x)</b>" which are rendered as the standard bar syntax for absolute value "<b>|x|</b>", the "<b>factorial (x)</b>" function becomes "<b>x!</b>" and "<b>exp (x)</b>" displays as "<b>e^x</b>".
Some other functions which are translated are "<b>Derivative</b>", "<b>diff</b>", "<b>Integral</b>", "<b>integrate</b>", "<b>Limit</b>", "<b>limit</b>", "<b>Matrix</b>", "<b>Piecewise</b>", "<b>pow</b>", "<b>Pow</b>" and "<b>Sum</b>", and more...
</p>

<h4 id="Lambda Functions">Lambda Functions</h4>

<p>
User created lambda functions are supported and are specified the same way as Python lambdas - "<b>lambda x, y: sqrt (x**2 + y**2)</b>".
In order to make use of them though you must assign them to a variable like "<b>f = lambda x: x**2</b>", or with the alternative shorthand "<b>f (x) = x**2</b>", now when you call "<b>f(3)</b>" you will get "<b>9</b>" as the result.
When a lambda function is defined any non-lambda argument variables are mapped but no functions are called or expressions doit()-ed, this means that if a lambda references an assigned global variable the variable will be replaced with its value within the lambda definition.
If you do not want to use the value of a global variable in a lambda definition but rather have the value bound upon execution of the lambda then use the no-remap pseudo-function as such "<b>f = lambda: @(x)</b>", this will leave the lambda definition referencing an "<b>x</b>" variable which will be bound upon execution.
This also means that if you create a lambda like "<b>f = lambda x: \int x dx</b>", the integral will not be evaluated until the lambda is executed, upon evaluation though whatever is passed in for "<b>x</b>" argument will be integrated with respect to x.
Lambda functions may reference other lambda functions as long as those are defined at the time of creation.
</p><p>
Lambdas may be passed to SymPy and other Python functions and they will be passed as SymPy "<b>Lambda</b>" objects.
Lambdas can be called directly like "<b>(lambda x: x**2) (3)</b>".
Lambda recursion is not supported because there is no underlying mechanism to make it work with SymPy "<b>Lambda</b>" objects.
</p>

<h4 id="Undefined Functions">Undefined Functions</h4>

<p>
Undefined functions are mathematical function objects but without any specific expression or lambda body defined, they are used mainly in differential equations.
These functions are entered explicitly as "<b>?name (x, y, ...)</b>" with the name being optional but necessary if you need to differentiate between various functions (like in a system of differential equations).
They can also be specified implicitly as "<b>name (x, y, ...)</b>" without the question mark if the function does not take any hints and the name is not already defined as another lambda function.
The arguments to an undefined function can only be variable names and optional keyword arguments which will be passed on to the SymPy "<b>Function()</b>" call.
The variable list for an undefined function, just like the variable list for a lambda function, is never remapped which means that even if you have the variable "<b>x</b>" assigned globally you can still use the variable name "<b>x</b>" in the definition of an undefined function.
Assignment to an undefined function at the highest level of an expression is a shortcut for defining a lambda function, e.g. "<b>f(x) = x**2</b>" is equivalent to "<b>f = lambda x: x**2</b>".
</p><p>
Undefined functions may be used directly in a "<b>dsolve()</b>" function to solve a differential equation, but it is cleaner to first map them to a variable so that the resulting equation looks as it normally does in mathematical syntax.
For example you can do "<b>dsolve (y(x)'' + 2y(x)' - y(x))</b>", but it is much cleaner to first set "<b>y = y(x)</b>" and then do "<b>dsolve (y'' + 2y' - y)</b>".
</p><p>
If you are solving a system of differential equations then it is even more useful to use variables since you will need to differentiate the undefined functions using names like "<b>x, y = x(t), y(t)</b>".
This will give you a clean "<b>dsolve ((x' = 12t x + 8y, y' = 21x + 7t y))</b>" instead of having to type the functions out constantly like "<b>dsolve ((x(t)' = 12t x(t) + 8 y(t), y(t)' = 21x(t) + 7t y(t)))</b>".
Initial values for differential functions are supported and can be passed of the form "<b>dsolve (y'' + 11y' + 24y, ics = {y(0): 0, y'(0): -7})</b>" if "<b>y = y(x)</b>" is already defined or "<b>dsolve (y(x)'' + 11y(x)' + 24y(x), ics = {y(x)(0): 0, y(x)'(0): -7})</b>" if it is not. The "<b>ics</b>" keyword argument is a dictionary of undefined functuions at specific points with their values.
</p>

<h4 id="Functions, Parentheses and Implicit Multiplication">Functions, Parentheses and Implicit Multiplication</h4>

<p>
SymPad supports implicit multiplication, that is writing two variables next to each other to indicate multiplication so "<b>x y</b>" = "<b>x * y</b>".
This brings some problems, such as deciding when "<b>x (a + b)</b>" is a function call and when it is multiplication.
SymPad solves this by recognizing all top-level SymPy package function names and classes as functions and accepting the next expression as the argument(s) to that function.
This brings along its own set of peculiarities such as removing those names from the possible namespace pool of variables, this means that you can never redefine "<b>sin</b>" as anything else, but why would you want to?
</p><p>
This recognition only works on top-level objects, for members of an object the presence of a parenthesized expression after the attribute name will imply a function call.
If that is not the intent and you instead want to treat the member as a data variable and multiply it with something then you must use explicit "<b>*</b>" multiplication or the curly parentheses as such "<b>\[1, 2, 3].T * (a + b)</b>" or "<b>\[1, 2, 3].T {a + b}</b>".
If you try to do this with regular parentheses then a function call will be attempted with "<b>a + b</b>" as the argument.
The meaning of parentheses for assigned user variables is inferred from whether the variable is a lambda or not, for lambdas parentheses are a function call and for other types they indicate multiplication.
</p><p>
In a roundabout sort of way this all led to a peculiar delima.
There is a namespace collision between the Greek letters "<b>beta</b>", "<b>zeta</b>", "<b>gamma</b>", "<b>Gamma</b>" and "<b>Lambda</b>" and SymPy functions with those names (well, lowercase SymPy "<b>gamma()</b>" really, but it is represented normally with the uppercase Greek letter).
This means that those function names could be encoded in the grammar and never be available for use as free variables, or they could be excluded from the grammar forcing the user to call them each time using the function escape character "<b>$</b>".
This was not very elegant so the workaround is as follows:
This is not a problem for "<b>beta</b>" and "<b>Lambda</b>" since they require multiple arguments and can be recognized as function calls from an implicit multiplication with a tuple of size 2, but the others can not be recognized this way.
</p><p>
These function names have been left out of the grammar but hidden lambda functions are created for them on startup so that they may be called using normal syntax.
These lambda functions do not appear in the normal list of functions shown by "<b>vars()</b>" but their status can be checked by using the "<b>env()</b>" function.
When these functions are mapped they are treated exactly like variables mapped to a lambda for the purposes of calling them, but they are still available as free variables to use and even assign to.
To enable or disable environment mapping of these functions like "<b>gamma()</b>" enter "<b>env (nogamma)</b>" or "<b>env (gamma=False)</b>" to disable and "<b>env (gamma)</b>" or "<b>env (gamma=True)</b>" to enable.
Note that objects like "<b>S.Half</b>" or "<b>S.ComplexInfinity</b>" are always available because they are special cased, even if "<b>S()</b>" is not mapped, though if it is assigned to something else then these attributes are lost.
Also remember that these functions are always available for calling using the "<b>$</b>" function call escape character regardless of if they are mapped in the environment or not.
</p>

<h2 id="Plotting">Plotting</h2>

<p>
Basic plotting functionality is available if you have the matplotlib Python module installed on your system.
These functions work more like statements in that they only work at the top level of the parse tree, which means you can not use them in other lambdas or tuples or assignments.

plotf (4pi, d / dx (sin x / x), sin x / x, \int sin x / x dx)<br>
</p>

<p><b>Usage</b></p>

<p>
SymPad provides the "<b>plotf()</b>" function which can be used to plot one or more expressions or lambdas of one free variable or lists of points or lines.
This function works by sampling a given expression at regular intervals to build up a list of x, y coordinates to pass on to matplotlib for rendering, the size of this sampling interval can be adjusted with a keyword argument.
The format of this plot function is as follows: "<b>plotf(['+',] [limits,] [*plots,] fs=None, res=12, style=None, **kwargs)</b>".
</p><p>
The initial optional "<b>'+'</b>" string signifies that the plot should build upon the previous plot which allows you to build up complex plots one function at a time.
The limits are an optional zero to four numbers which specify the boundaries of the requested plot, if no limit numbers are present then the plot will range from 0 to 1 on the x axis and the y axis will be determined automatically.
If one limit number is present then the plot will range from -x to +x of this number and the y is automatic, two numbers are interpreted as x0 and x1 and y is automatic, three is -x, x, y0 and y1 and four numbers let you specify the full range x0, x1, y0, y1 of the axes.
</p><p>
The "<b>fs</b>" keyword argument is a matplotlib "<b>figsize</b>" value which lets you specify the size of the plot. This can be either a single number in which case this specifies the x size and the y size is computed from this, or it can be a tuple specifying both the x and y sizes of the plot - the default is (6.4, 4.8).
If a single number is provided and it is positive then the y size is computed as x*3/4 of this number to give a plot area with a 4:3 aspect ratio.
It the single number is negative then the y size is set equal to the positive x size and the plot area will have a square aspect ratio.
</p><p>
The "<b>res</b>" keyword argument allows you to set the sampling resolution for the plot, the default is roughly 12 samples per 50 pixels of the plot.
This is useful to increase if the function is intricate and the default resolution does not capture some point of interest correctly.
</p><p>
The "<b>style</b>" keyword allows you to change to any of the default matplotlib styles for drawing the plots.
Some available styles are: "<b>bmh</b>", "<b>classic</b>", "<b>dark_background</b>", "<b>fast</b>", "<b>fivethirtyeight</b>", "<b>ggplot</b>", "<b>grayscale</b>", see the matplotlib documentation for a full list of styles.
If you pass the name of the style starting with a '-' minus sign such as "<b>-bmh</b>" then the plot will be rendered with a transparent background, otherwise the color of the background comes from the style.
The style which is set will persist for all future plots until it is changed.
</p><p>
Other keyword arguments from "<b>kwargs</b>" are passed through on to the "<b>matplotlib.pyplot.plot()</b>" function for each expression plotted.
In addition each expression or function to be plotted can also specify its own dictionary of matplotlib keyword arguments to use for that specific expression.
</p>

<p><b>Individual Plots</b></p>

<p>
The "<b>plotf()</b>" function can take any number of expressions to plot at once with their own formatting options.
The actual source of the data to be plotted can be an expression, a lambda function or a list of coordinate points which will be rendered as either a line of a certain style or just disconnected markers.
The format of each individual plot specification to the plotting function is as follows: "<b>expression [,'format'] [,{'kwarg': value, ...}]</b>".
As mentioned the expression can be just an expression like "<b>x**2</b>", a lambda of one variable "<b>lambda x: x**2</b>" or a list of paired "<b>[(x0, y0), (x1, y1), ...]</b>" or unpaired "<b>[x0, y0, x1, y1, ...]</b>" coordinates.
</p><p>
Following the expression is an optional string specifying the color, line or marker style and optional legend text for the expression.
The format of this string is an extension of the matplotlib format string to its "<b>plot()</b>" function and is as follows: "<b>[marker][line][color][#extended color][=legend text]</b>".
The "<b>marker</b>" option specifies which type of marker (if any) to place at each computed x, y coordinate, the possible options are: '.', ',', 'o', 'v', '^', '&lt;', '&gt;', '1', '2', '3', '4', 's', 'p', '*', 'h', 'H', '+', 'x', 'D', 'd', '|' and '_'.
The "<b>line</b>" option specifies which type of line (if any) connects the various x, y coordinates, the possible options are: '-', '--', '-.' and ':'.
The options for the simple color specifier "<b>color</b>" are 'b', 'g', 'r', 'c', 'm', 'y', 'k' and 'w', which is a quick one letter way to pick different colors.
If you need more control over color then use the extended color specifier which allows you to pick from the whole list of matplotlib named colors such as 'red', 'teal', 'mediumorchid' and 'salmon'.
You can also directly specify the RGB values of the color by entering an HTML RGB color specifier like '#ff8040'.
The last specifier is optional legend text for the expression, the presence of which is signalled by the '=' character immediately preceding it.
</p><p>
Following the format specifier is an optional dictionary of keyword argument and value pairs to be passed on to the matplotlib "<b>plot()</b>" function only for this given expression.
These arguments will override any global matplotlib keyword arguments specified in the call to the "<b>plotf()</b>" function.
</p><p>
Note that the presence of any plots at all in a call to "<b>plotf()</b>" is optional, you can call "<b>plotf()</b>" with the continue option '+' without any plots in order to resize the previous plot or change the axes.
Keep in mind that this does not re-plot any previously plotted functions so that data remains at whatever resolution it was plotted.

<h4 id="plotv() - Plot Vector Field (2D)">plotv() - Plot Vector Field (2D)</h4>

<p><b>Examples</b></p>

plotv (lambda x, y: (y, -x), 'dir')<br>

plotv (-2, 2, -2, 2, (v (sign (Max (u, 0)) * 2 - 1), -u (sign (Max (u, 0)) * 2 - 1)), 'dir', width = 0.003, pivot = 'mid', fs = -8)<br>
plotv (-6, 6, -2, 2, lambda x, y: (re (sin (x + i y)), im (sin (x + i y))), 'mag', '=sin (x + iy)', fs=-12, res=33)<br>
</p>

<p><b>Usage</b></p>

<p>
This function allows you to plot a 2-dimensional vector field specified by one or two functions or expressions via the matplotlib "<b>Quiver()</b>" function.
The format of this function is as follows: "<b>plotv (['+',] [limits,] func(s), [color,] [fmt,] [*walks,] fs = None, res = 13, style = None, resw = 1, kww = {}, **kw)</b>".
The initial optional "<b>'+'</b>" and "<b>limits</b>" fields work exactly as in the "<b>plotf()</b>" function, as do the keyword arguments "<b>fs</b>" and "<b>style</b>".
</p><p>
The actual vector field to be plotted comes from either one or two functions or expressions which provide either the u and v coordinates of the vectors or a v/u slope for the vector - in which case the vector will not have a direction arrowhead by default.
These function(s) are specified in the "<b>func(s)</b>" parameter and must be either a tuple of two functions or expressions or a single function or expression.
</p><p>
If there are two functions then they are called for each point sampled in the vector field with an x and y coordinate (the names of the symbols don't matter, the first argument is the x and the second is a y).
These functions must each return a single real value, the first function returns the u component of the vector field and the second returns the v component.
If instead of functions there is a tuple of two expressions, then the expressions together must have exactly two free variables which will be replaced with the x and y values of the vector field in alphabetical order, which means that expressions with free variables (a, b), (u, v) and (x, y) will recieve the x and y coordinates in that order.
</p><p>
If there is a single function or expression present then the interpretation of that function depends on what it returns.
If the return value is a single real number then it is interpreted as a slope at that point in the vector field and rendered as such a sloped line, this is useful for plotting things like differential functions.
If the return value has two components like a tuple or list of real values then those are treated as the u and v components of the vector field at that point directly and actually have a direction and magnitude unlike the single value slope.
</p><p>
The optional "<b>color</b>" parameter following the field functions(s) is either a function of four arguments "<b>lambda x, y, u, v: expr</b>" which will be called for each point of the vector field and should return a scalar, which scalar will be used to determine the relative color of the arrow at that point.
Or it can be a string specifying one of the pre-defined color functions: 'dir' for a direcitonal color function and 'mag' for a magnitude color function, note 'mag' option doesn't make much sense for a field function or expression which only returns a slope.
</p><p>
Following this is an optional format string which works much like the format strings from the "<b>plotf()</b>" function except omitting the "<b>[marker][line][color]</b>" prefix and using only "<b>[#extended color][=legend text]</b>".
If a color function is not specified before this string and a color is present then that color is used for the entire vector field.
A label can also be present for this particular vector field which can be useful if plotting more than one field.
</p><p>
Finally the "<b>res</b>" argument specifies a resolution - or rather the number of arrows you want horizontally in the plot.
If this argument is a single number then the number of arrows vertically across the plot is calculated from the aspect ratio of the plot as specified or not by the "<b>fs</b>" figsize argument.
If rather the "<b>res</b>" argument is a tuple of two numbers then these are used directly for the number of arrows horizontally and vertically in the plot.
</p><p>
Any keyword arguments are passed through on to the matplotlib "<b>Quiver()</b>" function which allows you to tweak certain display properties of the plot like line thicknesses and arrowheads, for a full list of these options see the matplotlib documentation.
Also notice that unlike the "<b>plotf()</b>" function, "<b>plotv()</b>" only plots one vector field at a time.
</p><p>
If any non-keyword arguments are present after the "<b>func(s)</b>", "<b>color</b>" and "<b>fmt</b>" parameters but before any keyword arguments then they are interpreted as parameters to the function "<b>plotw()</b>" which will be called after the vector field is plotted and will plot one or more walks over that vector field.
The "<b>resw</b>" parameter is passed on to "<b>plotw()</b>" as a keyword argument as well as the contents of the "<b>kww</b>" dictionary.
See the documentation for that function for usage and formatting of these parameters.

<h4 id="plotw() - Plot Walk Over Vector Field">plotw() - Plot Walk Over Vector Field</h4>

<p><b>WARNING!</b> This plotting function can be very slow due to the fact it calls very frequently into SymPy Lambda functions as it adapts the walk to minimize potential error.</p>

</p>

<p><b>Usage</b></p>

<p>
This function is normally intended to be called implicitly from the "<b>plotv()</b>" function for plotting a walk over a plotted vector field but can be called on its own to plot one or more walks without the vectory field in the background.
The format is as follows: "<b>plotw (['+',] [limits,] func(s), *points, fs = None, resw = 1, style = None, **kw)</b>"
The "<b>'+'</b>", "<b>limits</b>", "<b>fs</b>" and "<b>style</b>" fields work in the same manner as the previous two functions.
The "<b>func(s)</b>" is interpreted as a vector field function or pair of functions or expressions like in "<b>plotv()</b>".
"<b>resw</b>" is a resolution parameter - maximum pixel steps to allow walk step to deviate before drawing, smaller = better quality.
</p><p>
What this function does is take an x, y point (or points if multiple starting positions provided) and starts walking the vector field according to its value at that point - following the gradient.
It adapts the steps it takes according to how much curvature the vector field exhibits at that point and tries to reach either the edge of the graph or its own starting point to complete a loop.
The "<b>*points</b>" parameters specified in the function is either one or more tuples of x, y values optionally followed by "#color=label" formatting and dictionary keywords for the line corresponding to the walk for that point, similar to the previous functions.
An example of "<b>*points</b>": "<b>plotw(..., (0, 0), '#red=0,0', {'linewidth': 2}, (1, 1), '#green=1,1', {'linewidth': 3}, (2, 2), ...)</b>".
</p><p>
Due to numerical errors accumulating during the walk this is by no means a perfect plotting function and should be considered experimental.
Also due to the fact that the points of the vector field are gotten from SymPy operations and the number of times they are requested this function can be very slow.
It may also never finish if a complex circular vector field introduces enough errors so that the walk gets back to the starting point but not quite close enough to consider it a full loop then the walk will keep going around and around in circles and the function will not return, you have been warned.

Note that some of these are single line examples and others make use of variables.
If you see variables being assigned make sure to execute those lines before the lines which follow, also make sure to delete the variable assigment afterwards in order to not affect any other examples which expect those variables to be free.

<h4 id="Special Characters">Special Characters</h4>

<p><b>_</b> - Underscore represents the last successfully evaluated expression, assignment to variables is not considered a successful evaluation for this purpose.
Even if the object resulting from the expression is not natively known to SymPad it is stored on the server and so is available exactly as it was returned from the previous calculation by using underscore.</p>
<p><b>$</b> - "<b>$name</b>" - Dollar is a function name escape character which can be used to call functions which are not normally available at the top level of SymPad.</p>
<p><b>@</b> - "<b>@(expr)</b>" - Ampersand technically turns off variable remapping for any expression it encapsulates which means that if it wraps a global variable then the variable reference will be used and not its value.
This also applies to calling other lambdas within lambdas, if the call is escaped with the "<b>@()</b> function then the called lambda will be bound on execution rather than copied at definition.</p>
<p><b>?</b> - "<b>?name(vars)</b>" - Used for specifying an undefined function to be used for solving differential equations.
The name is optional but required if different functions of the same signature are needed like "<b>?x(t), ?y(t)</b>", otherwise you can just use "<b>?(t)</b>".</p>
<p><b>;</b> - Semicolon is used to separate statements on a single line to be executed as if they were individual statements on separate lines like in Pyhon, e.g. "<b>1; expand (_(x+1)); expand (_(x+1)); expand (_(x+1))</b>".
There is one caveat at the moment in that parsing is influenced by the variables assigned and these assignments are not done until after the whole line has been parsed.
What this means for example is that for ambiguous expressions like "<b>f(x)</b>" which can be interpreted either as a concrete lambda call or an undefined function the parser will not get it right if the variable "<b>f</b>" is assigned a lambda and then called on the same line after a semicolon.</p>
<p><b>Unicode Greek Letters</b> - α, β, γ, δ, ε, ζ, η, θ, ι, κ, λ, μ, ν, ξ, π, ρ, σ, τ, υ, φ, χ, ψ, ω, Γ, Δ, Θ, Λ, Ξ, Π, Σ, Υ, Φ, Ψ, Ω.</p>

<h4 id="Admin Functions">Admin Functions</h4>

<p><b>vars()</b> - Show all currently mapped variables.</p>
<p><b>del(var1, var2, ...)</b> - Delete variable assignments, lambda or non-lambda.</p>
<p><b>delall()</b> - Delete ALL variables, lambda and non-lambda.</p>
<p><b>env()</b> - Show or change current SymPad runtime environment.
Called without any arguments it will show the current state of the environment.
If arguments are present they specify turning on or off a certain aspect of SymPad functionality.
For example the quick input functionality "<b>quick</b>" may be turned on by specifying "<b>env(quick)</b>", "<b>env('quick')</b>" or "<b>env(quick=True)</b>", to turn it off specify "<b>env(noquick)</b>" or "<b>env(quick=False)</b>".</p>
<p><b>envreset()</b> - Reset environment to what it was at startup.</p>

<h4 id="Environment Settings for env()">Environment Settings for env()</h4>

<p>In quick input mode you should always use parentheses and in the case of the "<b>simplify</b>" option you need to use the quoted version "<b>env('simplify')</b>" due to that being a function name and how letters are parsed in quick mode.</p>

<p><b>EI</b> - Use variables "<b>E</b>" and "<b>I</b>" as Euler's constant and imaginary unit as opposed to "<b>e</b>" and "<b>i</b>".
This allows the Python code copied from SymPad to work directly with SymPy where the uppercase constants are used.</p>
<p><b>quick</b> - Quick single letter variable name input mode.</p>
<p><b>pyS</b> - Python representation number escaping with the "<b>S()</b>" function where potentially necessary, e.g. "<b>S(2)/3</b>".</p>
<p><b>simplify</b> - Post-evaluation simplification, this can sometimes cause problems if the expressions are somewhat complex since simplification can take some time, in that case simply turn this off.</p>
<p><b>matsimp</b> - Matrix simplification, this turns on a patch to SymPy which does a basic simplification step on intermediate matrix multiplication products which prevents matrix operations from blowing up.</p>
<p><b>doit</b> - Expression final SymPy doit() call. Normally after an expression is converted to an internal SymPy object that object's "<b>doit</b>" member is called to fully evaluate the expression, this can be surpressed by turning this option off.</p>
<p><b>N</b> - Mapping access to the SymPy "<b>N()</b>" function via the "<b>N</b>" variable.</p>
<p><b>O</b> - Mapping access to the SymPy "<b>O()</b>" function via the "<b>O</b>" variable.</p>
<p><b>S</b> - Mapping access to the SymPy "<b>S()</b>" function via the "<b>S</b>" variable.</p>
<p><b>gamma</b> - Mapping access to the SymPy "<b>gamma()</b>" function via the "<b>gamma</b>" variable.</p>
<p><b>Gamma</b> - Mapping access to the SymPy "<b>Gamma()</b>" function via the "<b>Gamma</b>" variable.</p>
<p><b>zeta</b> - Mapping access to the SymPy "<b>zeta()</b>" function via the "<b>zeta</b>" variable.</p>

<h4 id="Notes">Notes</h4>

<p>
<b>WARNING!</b> This http server implementation is nowhere near secure, this as well as the posibility of execution of arbitrary Python functions means you should never leave this server open to the internet by serving on an IP address visible to the external world.
</p><p>
Due to mixing operators from Python and LaTeX the grammar may be a little wonky in places so if something doesn't seem to work as it should try wrapping it in parentheses or putting a space between the problematic elements.
</p><p>
After filling up the browser with many pretty mathematical expressions you may note that it starts to get slower, simply reload the page, all your variables and history will be preserved.
Or try adding "<b>--ugly</b>" to the command line, this will use a quicker draft rendering for the math.
</p><p>
You can always tell whether SymPad will treat an identifier as a function or a variable by looking at the font which is used for the name, it is different for functions vs. variables.
Also, SymPad will give you an empty set of parentheses as an autocomplete option when it recognizes a function name (this only works for top-level SymPy functions).
</p><p>
If you are getting results which are just plain wrong, check to see if you have any variables or lambdas mapped which would be changing the evaluation.
</p><p>
If you are unable to use a keyword argument identifier in a function call because it is a reserved name then you can wrap it in quotes, Python strings are allowed as keyword identifiers specifically for this purpose.
</p><p>
Usually SymPad should be smart enough to figure out when a function argument is an equation and when it is a keyword assignment like in this function "<b>solve(x**2 = i)</b>".
However some room for ambiguity remains like in this function "<b>solve(i = x**2)</b>".
In cases like these you need to pass the equation followed by an explicit non-keyword argument like "<b>solve(i = x**2, x)</b>", by using the strict comparison double equals "<b>solve(i == x**2)</b>" or by wrapping the single-equals equation in parentheses "<b>solve((i = x**2))</b>".
</p><p>
The LaTeX parsing is not really comprehensive, it is geared towards being able to read back the LaTeX emitted by SymPad correctly.
</p><p>
SymPad inserts the current working directory at the beginning of the Python module search path which means that for example if you run SymPad in the SymPy development directory then the SymPy module used will be the development version.
</p><p>
The server runs a single thread for consistency and keeps a single global state (variables), this means that if have two browser windows open the results of calculations in one will be reflected in the other.
If you want a completely separate context then you can run another SymPad on a different port.
</p><p>
Keep in mind that if you copy to Python code and want it to run in SymPy you must be in uppercase "<b>EI</b>" mode or have the variables "<b>e</b>" and "<b>i</b>" in Python assigned to "<b>E</b>" and "<b>I</b>".
</p><p>
Quick input mode can cause keyword arguments to not be recognized correctly since it always separates letters into variables, if some keyword argument is not working in quick input mode then wrap it in quotes.
</p><p>
SymPad allows mixing of Python and SymPy objects in certain contexts where this would not normally be allowed by SymPy.
In these cases the Python code generated will not work in SymPy alone as those kinds of operations are not supported by SymPy, for example: "<b>x and [1, 2, 3]</b>" generates "<b>And (x, [1, 2, 3])</b>" which will not work outside of SymPad.
</p><p>
There are many SymPy objects which SymPad does not understand natively yet.
In any case where such an object is the result of an evalutation then the SymPy LaTeX representation will be used for the displayed answer and the SymPy str version of the element will be used in the native representation string, as well as the actual object which resulted from the previous calculation being stored in the "<b>_</b>" variable.
This should allow you to continue working with the calculation.
