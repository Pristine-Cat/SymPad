<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Sympad is a simple symbolic calculator / scratch pad. It is a labor of love and grew out of a desire for an easy way to calculate a quick integral while
studying some math without having to start a shell every time and import a package or fire up a browser and navigate to a site (technincally
that last bit is exactly what happens but the response time is better :) This desire for simplicity led to the single script option "sympad.py"
which I could plop down on my desktop and execute when needed.
</p><p>
As said, SymPad is a symbolic calculator using SymPy for the math and MathJax for the display in a web browser. It runs as a private http server
on your machine and executes the system default browser pointing to itself on startup. User input is intended to be quick, easy and intuitive and
is displayed in symbolic form as it is being entered. Sympad will accept LaTeX math formatting as well as Python expressions (or a mix) and
evaluate the result symbolically or numerically. The best way to see what it can do is to try a few things...
</p>

<h4>Quick Start</h4>

<p>
Try entering any of the following into SymPad:
</p><p>
sin (3\pi / 2)<br>
cos**-1 x<br>
\log_2{8}<br>
\lim_{x \to \infty} 1/x<br>
Limit (\frac1x, x, 0, dir='-')<br>
\sum_{n=0}^oo x^n / n!<br>
\sum_{n=1}**10 Sum (\sum_{l=1}^m l, (m, 1, n))<br>
d/dx x**2<br>
Derivative (\int dx, x)<br>
d**6 / dxdy**2dz**3 x^3 y^3 z^3<br>
Integral (e^{-x^2}, (x, 0, \infty))<br>
\int_0^1 \int_0^x \int_0^y 1 dz dy dx<br>
\int_0^\infty e^{-st} dt<br>
{{1,2},{3,4}}**-1<br>
det({{sin x, -cos x}, {cos x, sin x}})<br>
\<span></span>begin{matrix} A & B \\ C & D \end{matrix} * {x, y}<br>
{{1,2,3},{4,5,6}}.transpose ()<br>
expand {x+1}**2<br>
factor (x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1)<br>
series (e^x, x, 1, 9)<br>
a, b, c, d = {{1,2},{3,4}}<br>
</p>

<h4>Usage</h4>

<p>
You enter expresstions and they get evaluated. The expressions may be in normal Pythonic style like "<b>a * (b + sin (x)**2 + 3/4) / 2</b>",
LaTeX such as "<b>a\frac{b+\sin^2{x}+\frac34}{2}</b>" or a mix "<b>a * (b + \sin**x{2} + \frac34) / 2</b>". The input is displayed symbolically as
you type. Input history is supported with the up and down arrows.
</p><p>
The symbolic expressions can be copied to the clipboard in various formats.
Single-click for a simple native format meant to be pasted back into the input field.
A double click-copies the expression in Python format suitable for pasting into a Python shell or source file.
Finally, a triple-click will copy the expression in LaTeX format.
The single-click native format will always be pasteable back into SymPad whereas the Python and LaTeX formats may or may not be depending on what elements are present.
</p>

<h2>Types</h2>

<h4>Numbers</h4>

<p>
Numbers take the standard integer or floating point form or exponential form such as 123, -2.567, 1e+100, 3E-45 or -1.521e22.
The precision for all SymPy Floats used in evaluation is set to the highest precision number present in the equation, so if you ask for the cosine of a number with 50 decimal digits your answer will have at least 50 decimal digits.
</p><p>
Keep in mind that "<b>e</b>" or "<b>E</b>" is the Euler"s number constant $e$ and if you are trying to enter 2 times $e$ plus 22 then do not write it all together as "<b>2e+22</b>" as this will be interpreted to be "<b>2 * 10^22</b>".
Instead, use spaces and/or explicit multiplication: "<b>2 * e + 22</b>".
Imaginary numbers are entered using the imaginary unit "<b>i</b>" or "<b>I</b>" depending on preference, no Pythonic "<b>j</b>" option at the moment but it can be hacked by setting "<b>j = i</b>" in SymPad.
</p>

<h4>Variables</h4>

<p>
Variable names mostly follow LaTeX convention, they are single Latin letters "<b>x</b>", "<b>y</b>", "<b>z</b>", "<b>A</b>", "<b>B</b>", etc... or
single Greek letters preceded by a slash such as "<b>\alpha</b>" ($\alpha$), "<b>\epsilon</b>" ($\epsilon$) or "<b>\Psi</b>" ($\Psi$). The
variable names "<b>i</b>", "<b>e</b>" and "<b>\pi</b>" represent their respective mathematical constants $i$, $e$ and $\pi$. The whole top-level
namespace of the SymPy package is made available as functions or variables. This means that "<b>pi</b>" and "<b>oo</b>" are also available for $\pi$
and $\infty$, as well as any other variables present at the top level. Python's "<b>None</b>", "<b>True</b>" and "<b>False</b>" are also present.
</p><p>
By default lower case "<b>e</b>" and "<b>i</b>" are used to represent Euler's number and the imaginary unit instead of the default SymPy upper case "<b>E</b>" and "<b>I</b>".
This is objectively prettier, but can be changed via the "<b>$sympyEI (True)</b>" and "<b>$sympyEI (False)</b>" function.
The SymPy constant usage can also be activated via the command line switch "<b>--sympyEI</b>".
</p><p>
Variable names may be followed by various primes ' such as "<b> a' </b>" ($a'$) or "<b> \omega'' </b>" ($\omega''$).
Variables may be subscripted with other variables or numbers "<b>x_1</b>" ($x_1$), "<b>y_z</b>" ($y_z$), "<b>\alpha_\omega</b>" ($\alpha_\omega$).
This can be extended to silly levels "<b> \gamma_{x_{y_0'}''}''' </b>" ($\gamma_{x_{y_0'}''}'''$).
</p><p>
Differentials are entered as "<b>dx</b>", "<b>\partialx</b>" or "<b>\partial x</b>" and are treated as a single variable. If you want to enter "<b>d</b>"
* "<b>x</b>" multiplied implicitly then put a space between them or two spaces between the "<b>\partial</b>" and the "<b>x</b>".
</p><p>
Variables may be assigned values, references to other variables or even entire expressions which will subsequently be substituted for those variables in any future expression evaluation.
</p>

<h4>Vectors and Matrices</h4>

<p>
These are specified using curly braces with commas. Vectors are passed as a single level of curlys such as "<b>{1, 2}</b>" or "<b>{x, y, z}</b>".
Matrices are passed as nested rows of curlys. A 2x3 matrix would be specified as  "<b>{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}}</b>", a 1x3 would be "<b>{{1, 2, 3},}</b>"
and a 3x1 would be "<b>{{1,},{2,},{3,}}</b>". Note the trailing commas which are needed for the same reason as in Python for tuples of one element
(otherwise the curlys would be treated as parenteses instead of vectors / matrices).
</p><p>
Currently I haven't figured out the best way to interface with the SymPy vector module so SymPad coerces vectors to single column matrices. This at
least allows computation with them until I figure out how best to use the vector module.
</p>

<h4>Strings</h4>

<p>
These exist for the sole purpose of passing string arguments to SymPy functions. They work as expected being enclosed by single or double quotes and
supporting escape sequences. For example "<b>Limit (1/x, x, 0, '-')</b>".
</p>

<h4>Lists</h4>

<p>
Standard Python bracket enclosed potentially nested lists which like strings exist for the purpose of passing parameters to functions like
"<b>Matrix ([[1,2],[3,4]])</b>"
</p>

<h4>Tuples</h4>

<p>
Same...
</p>

<h2>Operations</h2>

<h4>Addition and Multiplication</h4>

<p>
Addition is addition and subtraction is subtraction: "<b>a + b</b>", "<b>a - b</b>". Multiplication is explicit with a "<b>*</b>" operator or implicit
simply by writing two symbols next to each other so that "<b>a * b</b>" is the same as "<b>ab</b>". There is however a difference between the two in that
the implicit version has a higher precedence than the explicit, which means that explicit multiplication will end a limit, sum, derivative or division
"<b>/</b>" expression whereas implicit multiplication will not, e.g. "<b>1/xy</b>" = $\frac{1}{xy}$ whereas "<b>1/x*y</b>" = $\frac{1}{x} \cdot y$.
</p><p>
Division also has two operators, the normal "<b>/</b>" which has a fairly low precedence and the LaTeX "<b>\frac</b>" version which has a very high
precedence, even higher than exponentiation. So high in fact that parentheses are not needed if using "<b>\frac</b>" as an exponent as in
"<b>x^\frac{1}{2}</b>" = $x^\frac{1}{2}$. The "<b>\frac</b>" operation also does not need parentheses if using single digit operands or single letter
variables (Latin or Greek) such as "<b>\frac12</b>" = $\frac12$, "<b>\frac\alpha\beta</b>" = $\frac\alpha\beta$ or "<b>\fracxy</b>" = $\frac xy$ (although
this last version without a space before the x is not legal in LaTeX but convenient for quick typing here).
</p>

<h4>Exponentiation</h4>

<p>
There are two power opearators "<b>^</b>" and "<b>**</b>". They have the same precedence and can be used interchangeably but follow slightly different
parsing rules. The "<b>^</b>" operator follows LaTeX rules which only allow a single positive digit or letter variable (Lating or Greek) without the use
of curly braces whereas the "<b>**</b>" follows Python rules which allow negative values or variables or functions. To illustrate the diffference:
"<b>x**-2</b>" = $x^{-2}$ whereas "<b>x^-2</b>" = $x^-2$ (which makes no sense). Also, "<b>e**log(x)</b>" will work as expected $e^{\log(x)}$ whereas
"<b>e^log(x)</b>" = $e^log(x)$.
</p>

<h4>Logarithms</h4>

<p>
The natural logarithm of x is specified by "<b>lnx</b>", "<b>\ln x</b>", "<b>log x</b>", "<b>\log{x}</b>". A logarithm in a specific base is specified
by "<b>\log_b x</b>" = $\log_b x$, "<b>log_{10}(1000)</b>" = $\log_{10} {1000}$ = 3, etc...
</p>

<h4>Roots</h4>

<p>
The square root of x ($\sqrt{x}$) may be entered in any of these forms "<b>sqrtx</b>", "<b>\sqrt x</b>", "<b>sqrt (x)</b>", "<b>\sqrt{x}</b>", with or without the slash.
The cube (or any other) root is similar, $\sqrt[3]x$ = "<b>sqrt[3]x</b>", "<b>sqrt[3] (x)</b>" or "<b>\sqrt[3] {x}</b>".
</p>

<h4>Factorial</h4>

<p>
"<b>4!</b>" = "<b>24</b>", "<b>x!</b>" = "<b>factorial(x)</b>", "<b>(-0.5)!</b>" = "<b>1.77245385090552</b>" and "<b>simplify(x!/x)</b>" = "<b>gamma(x)</b>".
</p>

<h4>Limits</h4>

<p>
To take the limit of an expression "<b>z</b>" as variable "<b>x</b>" approaches "<b>y</b>" enter "<b>\lim_{x \to y} (z)</b>" = $\lim_{x\to y} (z)$.
This will only give the limit if it exists and is the same when approaching from both directions, unlike SymPy which defaults to approaching from the
positive direction. To specify a direction add "<b>^+</b>" or "<b>^-</b>" to the equation as such: "<b>\lim_{x \to 0^+} 1/x</b>" = $\lim_{x\to 0^+}
\frac1x$ = $\infty$ and "<b>\lim_{x \to 0^-} 1/x</b>" = $\lim_{x\to 0^-} \frac1x$ = $-\infty$. Addition and explicit multiplication terminate a limit
expression. Limits may also be entered using the standard SymPy syntax "<b>Limit (expression, variable, to)</b>", this defaults to limit from positive
direction like SymPy, or you may specify a direction "<b>Limit (expression, variable, to, dir='+-')</b>".
</p>

<h4>Sums</h4>

<p>
The summation (finite or infinite) of expression "<b>z</b>" as variable "<b>n</b>" ranges from "<b>a</b>" to "<b>b</b>" is written as "<b>\sum_{n=a}^b
(z)</b>" = $\sum_{n=a}^b (z)$. Iterated sums work as expected, "<b>\sum_{n=1}^3 \sum_{m=1}^n m</b>" = $\sum_{n=1}^3 \sum_{m=1}^n m$ = 10. Addition and
explicit multiplication terminate a sum expression.
Sums may also be entered using the standard SymPy syntax "<b>Sum (expression, (variable, from, to))</b>".
</p>

<h4>Differentiation</h4>

<p>
The derivative of expression "<b>z</b>" with respect to "<b>x</b>" is entered as "<b>d/dx z</b>" or "<b>\frac{d}{dx} z</b>" = $\frac{d}{dx} z$. The
second derivative is "<b>d^2/dx^2 (z)</b>" or "<b>\frac{d^2}{dx^2} (z)</b>" = $\frac{d^2}{dx^2} (z)$. Using "<b>\partial</b>" ($\partial$) is allowed but
must be consistent within the expression. Mixed derivatives are entered as "<b>d^2/dxdy (z)</b>" or "<b>\partial^2 / \partial x\partial y (z)</b>" =
$\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x\partial y} (z)$. Derivatives may also be entered using the standard SymPy syntax "<b>Derivative (expression, var1, var2,
power2, ...)</b>".
</p>

<h4>Integration</h4>

<p>
The anti-derivative of expression "<b>z</b>" with respect to x is written as "<b>\int z dx</b>" = $\int z\ dx$. The definite integral from "<b>a</b>" to
"<b>b</b>" is "<b>\int_a^b z dx</b>" = $\int_a^b z\ dx$. "<b>\int dx/x</b>" = $\int \frac1x\ dx$. Iterated and improper integrals also work. Integrals
may also be entered using the standard SymPy syntax "<b>Integral (expression, (variable, from, to))</b>".
</p>

<h4>(In)equalities</h4>

<p>
Are parsed from the standard Python "<b>=, ==, !=, &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=</b>" or LaTeX "<b>\ne, \neq, \lt, \le, \gt, \ge</b>" symbols.
Currently only a single comparison is allowed so an expression like "<b>0 &lt;= x &lt;= 2</b>" is not valid.
Note that the "<b>=</b>" and "<b>==</b>" operators are equivalent for SymPy and mapped to the same "<b>Eq</b>" object in expressions but the single "<b>=</b>" operator has a higher precedence than the others and is used by SymPad for variable assignment whereas the double "<b>==</b>" only ever implies comparison.
</p>

<h4>Parentheses</h4>

<p>
Explicit "<b>( )</b>" or implicit curly "<b>{ }</b>" parentheses allow prioritization of lower precedence operations over higher ones as usual and also
delineate an expression as an input to a function. They may be used interchangeably for single expressions, the only difference being that the implicit
version is not drawn if it does not need to be. The case where explicit "<b>( )</b>" parentheses are needed ... explicitly ... is when calling functions
in general and always when calling functions which take multiple parameters like "<b>max(1,2,3)</b>". The curly braces are used as shorthand for vectors
and matrices if commas are present, but that is a different syntactic usage, curlys with no commas are essentially invisible parentheses.
</p>

<h4>Member Access</h4>

<p>
You can access member data or functions of an expression just like in Python with the "<b>.</b>" operator.
If the attribute name following the dot is followed by a parenthesized expression then it will be treated as a function call, otherwise it is a data member.
For example, two ways to get the transpose of a matrix are "<b>{{1,2,3},{4,5,6}}.T</b>" and "<b>{{1,2,3},{4,5,6}}.transpose ()</b>".
</p>

<h4>Variable Assignment</h4>

<p>
Using the syntax "<b>var = expression</b>" you can assign some value to be substituted for that variable in all expressions.
For example, doing "<b>x = pi</b>" and then evaluating "<b>cos x</b>" will give you "<b>-1</b>".
Anything can be assigned to any valid variable, valid mathematical expressions, Python objects like strings or lists or even references to other variables.
To delete an assignment use the "<b>del var</b>" function, to delete all assignments do "<b>delall</b>" and to see what variables are currently assigned to, use the "<b>vars</b>" function.
</p><p>
Tuple assignment is supported and as in Python the source can be another tuple or a single iterable object.
An impractical example of this would be setting "<b> a, b, c = 'str' </b>" which would give you "<b> a = 's' </b>", "<b> b = 't' </b>" and "<b> c = 'r' </b>".
</p><p>
There are two distinct types of assignment that can occur and you should be aware of the difference between them.
Copy assignment is the standard type of assignment used by default in most computer languages where if you start with "<b>x = 1</b>" and you then enter "<b>y = x</b>" then the value "<b>1</b>" will be copied to the "<b>y</b>" variable.
The value of "<b>y</b>" will be independent of whatever else happens to the variable "<b>x</b>" after this.
The other kind of assignment is a reference assignment which will map the source variable instead of copying its value to the target.
This means that if you have a reference set like "<b>y = x</b>" and the value of "<b>x</b>" changes then the value of "<b>y</b>" will reflect this new value.
The reference assignment happens if you try to assign variables which do not exist, so setting "<b>y = x</b>" before "<b>x</b>" has been created will result in a reference.
Otherwise you can force a reference by using the "<b>@()</b>" meta-function.
Doing "<b>y = @x</b>" will create a reference to "<b>x</b>" itself instead of copying the value.
</p>

<h2>Functions</h2>

<p>
Almost all SymPy functions are available directly just by typing their name, the exceptions being single letter functions like "<b>N</b>" or "<b>S</b>".
These can be executed using the escape character "<b>$</b>" before the name.
To numerically evaluate the value of "<b>sin (2)</b>" type in "<b>$N (sin (2))</b>".
Functions may take multiple comma-separated arguments with optional keyword arguments as well. The keyword argument identifier
implementation is hacked into the grammar so if a keyword name can not be entered correctly (due to underscores) then try entering the identifier name as an explicit string such as "<b> 'this_identifier_has_too__many___underscores' = value </b>".
</p><p>
The standard trigonometric and hyperbolic functions and their inverses can be entered as usual, the forward functions with or without a leading slash: "<b>sin</b>", "<b>\coth</b>".
The inverses are entered as Pythonic functions without a slash like "<b>atan</b>" or "<b>acscsh</b>" and the LaTeX versions take a slash and and are spelled out "<b>\arctan</b>".
The inverses may also be specified using the common mathematical syntax: "<b>\tan^{-1}x</b>" or "<b>cos**-1 x</b>".
</p><p>
This last form of exponentiating a function is extended as an input shortcut to all functions so that typing "<b>ln**2x</b>" is a quick way to enter "<b>(ln(x))**2</b>".
Keep in mind that the "<b>-1</b>" exponent in this context is just a -1 and does not specify the inverse function as it does for the forward trigonometric and hyperbolic functions.
</p><p>
Functions don't technically require explicit parentheses in order to allow quick entry like "<b>sqrt2</b>" but for any parameter more complicated than another function or variable to a power they will be needed.
Functions which take more than one parameter always require explicit parentheses.
</p><p>
Most functions which have an explicit mathematical display syntax are translated on the fly for correct rendering.
These include the functions "<b>abs/Abs (x)</b>" which are translated to the standard bar syntax for absolute value "<b>|x|</b>", the "<b>factorial (x)</b>" function is identical to writing "<b>x!</b>" and "<b>exp (x)</b>" is the same as writing "<b>e^x</b>".
Other functions which are translated are "<b>Derivative</b>", "<b>diff</b>", "<b>Integral</b>", "<b>integrate</b>", "<b>Limit</b>", "<b>limit</b>", "<b>Matrix</b>", "<b>pow</b>", "<b>Pow</b>" and "<b>Sum</b>".
</p><p>
The "<b>$</b>" escape character allows you to execute arbitrary functions which are not normally accepted by the grammar. Function names specifically recognized by the grammar are only those specified in the SymPy module and a few builtins.
When functions are entered using the "<b>$</b>" character then many more __builtin__ functions may be accessed, for whatever reason, whether useful or not.
Try entering "<b>$print ('Hello World...')</b>" and have a look at the server output.
Note that only the non-dangerous __builtin__ functions are specifically included in this list, functions like "<b>eval</b>", "<b>exec</b>" and many more have been left out and are not accessible.
</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>
<b>WARNING!</b> This http server implementation is nowhere near secure, this as well as the posibility of execution of arbitrary Python functions means you should never leave this server open to the internet by serving on an IP address visible to the external world.
</p><p>
Due to mixing operators from Python and LaTeX the grammar may be a little wonky in places so if something doesn't seem to work as it should try wrapping it in parentheses or putting a space between the problematic elements.
</p><p>
There is a special use for the "<b>_</b>" underscore character aside from variable subscripting which is the same as in the Python interactive shell in that it represents the last expression successfully evaluated.
To see this in action type in "<b>1</b>" and hit Enter, then type in "<b>expand ((x+1)*_)</b>" and hit Enter.
Repeat this several times using the up arrow.
</p><p>
If you are getting results which are just plain wrong, check to see if you have any variables mapped which would be changing the evaluation.
</p><p>
There are many SymPy objects which SymPad does not understand natively yet. In any case where such an object is the result of an evalutation then the SymPy LaTeX representation will be used for the displayed answer and the SymPy str version of the object will be used as the Python copy string.
This may or may not allow you to paste the Python string back into SymPad to continue working with the result.
A single-click copy of the result will have the element(s) which was/were not understood replaced with "<b>nan</b>".
