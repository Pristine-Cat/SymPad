<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
Sympad is a simple symbolic calculator. It is a labor of love and grew out of a desire for an easy way to calculate a quick integral while
studying some math without having to start a shell every time and import a packaged or fire up a browser and navigate to a site (technincally
that last bit is exactly what happens but the response time is better :) This desire for simplicity led to the single script option "sympad.py"
which I could plop down on my desktop and execute when needed.
</p><p>
As said, SymPad is a symbolic calculator using SymPy for the math and MathJax for the display in a web browser. It runs as a private web server
on your machine and executes the system default browser pointing to itself on startup. User input is intended to be quick, easy and intuitive and
is displayed in symbolic form as it is being entered. Sympad will accept LaTeX math formatting as well as Python expressions (or a mix) and
evaluate the result symbolically or numerically. The best way to see what it can do is to try a few things...
</p>

<h3>Quick Start</h3>

<p>
Try entering any of the following into SymPad:
</p><p>
? sqrt 2<br>
sin (3\pi / 2)<br>
cos**-1 x<br>
\log_2{8}<br>
\lim_{x \to \infty} 1/x<br>
Limit (1/x, x, 0, dir='-')<br>
\sum_{n=0}^oo x^n / n!<br>
\sum_{n=1}**10 Sum (\sum_{l=1}^m l, (m, 1, n))<br>
Derivative (\int dx, x)<br>
d**6/dxdy**2dz**3 x^3 y^3 z^3<br>
Integral (e^{-x^2}, (x, 0, \infty))<br>
\int_0^1 \int_0^x \int_0^y 1 dz dy dx<br>
\int_0^\infty e^{-st} dt<br>
expand {x+1}**2<br>
factor (x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1)<br>
series (e^x, x, 1, 9)<br>
</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>
You enter expresstions and they get evaluated. The expressions may be in normal Pythonic style like "<b>a * (b + sin (x)**2 + 3/4) / 2</b>",
LaTeX such as "<b>a\frac{b+\sin^2{x}+\frac34}{2}</b>" or a mix "<b>a * (b + \sin**x{2} + \frac34) / 2</b>". The input is displayed symbolically as
you type. Input history is supported with the up and down arrows.
</p><p>
The symbolic expressions can be copied to the clipboard in various formats. Single click for a simple short format meant to be pasted back into the
input field. A double click copies the expression in Python format suitable for pasting into a Python shell or source file. Note in this case that
"<b>e</b>" is copied as "<b>e</b>" and not the SymPy "<b>E</b>", "<b>i</b>" is copied as "<b>i</b>" and not "<b>I</b>" or "<b>1j</b>". Simply set
"<b>e = E</b>" and "<b>i = I</b>" or "<b>i = 1j</b>" in the Python context depending on need. Finally a triple click will copy the expression in
LaTeX format. The simple and LaTeX formats should be directly pasteable into SymPad whereas the Python representation may or may not be depending
on what elements it includes.
</p><p>
There is a special use for the "<b>_</b>" character which has the same meaning as in the Python interactive shell in that it represents the last
expression successfully evaluated. To see this in action type in "<b>1</b>" and hit Enter, then type in "<b>expand ((x+1)*_)</b>" and hit Enter.
Repeat this several times using the up arrow. This character may not want to follow directly after an alphanumeric character since it is also used
to subscript variables, in this case simply precede it with a space.
</p>

<h3>Numbers</h3>

<p>
Numbers take the standard integer or floating point form or exponential form such as 123, -2.567, 1e+100, 3E-45 or -1.521e22.
Keep in mind that "<b>e</b>" is the Euler"s number constant $e$ and if you are trying to enter 2 times $e$ plus 22 then do not write it all together
as "<b>2e+22</b>" as this will be interpreted to be 2 * 10^22, use spaces and/or explicit multiplication: 2 * e + 22.
</p>

<h3>Variables</h3>

<p>
Variable names mostly follow LaTeX convention, they are single latin letters "<b>x</b>", "<b>y</b>", "<b>z</b>", "<b>A</b>", "<b>B</b>", ... or
single greek letters preceded by a backslash such as "<b>\alpha</b>" ($\alpha$), "<b>\beta</b>" ($\beta$), \Psi ($\Psi$), etc... The variable names
"<b>i</b>", "<b>e</b>" and "<b>\pi</b>" represent their respective mathematical constants $i$, $e$ and $\pi$. There are two special case variables
which are parsed as two letter constants without a slash since they are commonly used, those are "<b>pi</b>" without the slash and "<b>oo</b>" which
represents "<b>\infty</b>" or $\infty$.
</p><p>
Variable names may be followed by various primes ' such as "<b> a' </b>" ($a'$) or "<b> \omega'' </b>" ($\omega''$).
Variables may be subscripted with other variables or numbers "<b>x_1</b>" ($x_1$), "<b>y_z</b>" ($y_z$), "<b>\alpha_\omega</b>" ($\alpha_\omega$).
This can be extended to silly levels "<b> \gamma_{x_{y_0'}''}''' </b>" ($\gamma_{x_{y_0'}''}'''$).
</p><p>
Differentials entered as "<b>dx</b>", "<b>\partialx</b>" or "<b>\partial x</b>" and are treated as a single variable. If you want to enter "<b>d</b>"
* "<b>x</b>" multiplied implicitly then put a space between them or two spaces between the "<b>\partial</b>" and the "<b>x</b>".
</p><p>
Other special variables are "<b>True</b>", "<b>False</b>" and "<b>undefined</b>", the last one is what you get if you try to divide 0 by 0.
</p>

<h3>Strings</h3>

<p>
These exist for the sole purpose of passing string arguments to SymPy functions. They work as expected being enclosed by single or double quotes and
supporting escape sequences.
</p>

<h3>Parentheses</h3>

<p>
Explicit "<b>()</b>" or implicit curly "<b>{}</b>" parentheses allow prioritization of lower precedence operations over higher ones as usual and also
delineate an expression as an input to a function. They may be used interchangeably mostly, the only difference being that the implicit version is not
drawn if it does not need to be. The case where explicit "<b>()</b>" parentheses are needed ... explicitly ... is when calling functions which take
multiple parameters like "<b>$atan2(-1,-2)</b>".
</p>

<h3>Addition and Multiplication</h3>

<p>
Addition is addition and subtraction is subtraction: "<b>a + b</b>", "<b>a - b</b>". Multiplication is explicit with a "<b>*</b>" operator or implicit
simply by writing two symbols next to each other so that "<b>a * b</b>" is the same as "<b>ab</b>". There is however a difference between the two in that
the implicit version has a higher precedence than the explicit, which means that explicit multiplication will end a limit, sum, derivative or division
"<b>/</b>" expression whereas implicit multiplication will not, e.g. "<b>1/xy</b>" = $\frac{1}{xy}$ whereas "<b>1/x*y</b>" = $\frac{1}{x} \cdot y$.
</p><p>
Division also has two operators, the normal "<b>/</b>" which has a fairly low precedence and the LaTeX "<b>\frac</b>" version which has a very high
precedence, even higher than exponentiation. So high in fact that parentheses are not needed if using "<b>\frac</b>" as an exponent as in
"<b>x^\frac{1}{2}</b>" = $x^\frac{1}{2}$. The "<b>\frac</b>" operation also does not need parentheses if using single digit operands or single letter
variables (latin or greek) such as "<b>\frac12</b>" = $\frac12$, "<b>\frac\alpha\beta</b>" = $\frac\alpha\beta$ or "<b>\fracxy</b>" = $\frac xy$ (although
this last version without a space before the x is not legal in LaTeX but convenient for quick typing here).
</p>

<h3>Exponentiation</h3>

<p>
There are two power opearators "<b>^</b>" and "<b>**</b>". They have the same precedence and can be used interchangeably but follow slightly different
parsing rules. The "<b>^</b>" operator follows LaTeX rules which only allow a single positive digit or letter variable (lating or greek) without the use
of curly braces whereas the "<b>**</b>" follows Python rules which allow negative values or variables or functions. To illustrate the diffference:
"<b>x**-2</b>" = $x^{-2}$ whereas "<b>x^-2</b>" = $x^-2$ (which makes no sense). Also, "<b>e**log(x)</b>" will work as expected $e^{\log(x)}$ whereas
"<b>e^log(x)</b>" = $e^log(x)$.
</p>

<h3>Logarithms</h3>

<p>
The natural logarithm of x is specified by "<b>lnx</b>", "<b>\ln x</b>", "<b>log x</b>", "<b>\log{x}</b>". A logarithm in a specific base is specified
by "<b>\log_b x</b>" = $\log_b x$, "<b>log_{10}(1000)</b>" = $\log_{10} {1000}$ = 3, etc...
</p>

<h3>Roots</h3>

<p>
The square root of x ($\sqrt{x}$) may be entered in any of these forms "<b>sqrtx</b>", "<b>\sqrt x</b>", "<b>sqrt (x)</b>", "<b>\sqrt{x}</b>", with or
without the backslash. The cube (or any other) root is similar, $\sqrt[3]x$ = "<b>sqrt[3]x</b>", "<b>sqrt[3] (x)</b>" or "<b>\sqrt[3] {x}</b>".
</p>

<h3>Functions</h3>

<p>
Currently several functions are supported directly, with a mechanism for calling any other existing SymPy function explicitly. The standard trigonometric
and hyperbolic functions and their inverses can be entered as usual, with or without leading backslash: "<b>sin</b>", "<b>acos</b>", "<b>arctan</b>",
"<b>\acosh</b>", etc... In addition these functions accept a special commonly used syntax for exponentiation or inverses as a convenience. For example
"<b>sin^2(x)</b>" = $\sin^2(x)$ and "<b>\tan^{-1}x</b>" = $\arctan(x)$.
</p><p>
Other SymPy functions are supported directly such as "<b>simplify (sin(x) / cos(x))</b>" = $\tan(x)$, "<b>expand ({x+1}^3)</b>" = $x^3+3x^2+3x+1$ and
"<b>factor (x^2 + 2x + 1)</b>" = $(x+1)^2$. Functions don't technically REQUIRE explicit or implicit parentheses but for any parameter more complicated
than another function or variable to a power they will be needed, as well as if the function takes more than one parameter in which case explicit
parentheses are needed.
</p><p>
Three functions have a special separate syntax. The functions "<b>abs/Abs (x)</b>" are equivalent to the standard bar syntax for absolute value
"<b>|x|</b>", the "<b>factorial (x)</b>" function is identical to writing "<b>x!</b>" and "<b>exp (x)</b>" is the same as writing "<b>e^x</b>". In fact
those functions are translated on the fly.
</p><p>
If a SymPy function is not supported directly (and most are not) then it can still be called using a special leading escape character "<b>\($\)</b>".
To call the SymPy "<b>sign</b>" function for example simply enter "<b>\($\)sign (-2)</b>". Functions may take multiple comma-separated arguments with
optional keyword args as well. The keyword argument identifier implementation is hacked into the grammar so if a keyword name can not be entered directly
then try entering as a string like "<b>'this_name_has_too__many___underscores' = value</b>".
</p><p>
There is a special function "<b>?</b>", this is equivalent to SymPy "<b>N ()</b>" or "<b>evalf ()</b>" and it will ask SymPy to numerically evaluate
whatever it can in the given expression. This is how you would get the numerical value of $\sqrt 2$ or $\sin(2)$ writing "<b>? sqrt 2</b>" or
"<b>? (\sin{2})</b>".
</p>

<h3>Limits</h3>

<p>
To take the limit of an expression "<b>z</b>" as variable "<b>x</b>" approaches "<b>y</b>" enter "<b>\lim_{x \to y} (z)</b>" = $\lim_{x\to y} (z)$.
This will only give the limit if it exists and is the same when approaching from both directions, unlike SymPy which defaults to approaching from the
positive direction. To specify a direction add "<b>^+</b>" or "<b>^-</b>" to the equation as such: "<b>\lim_{x \to 0^+} 1/x</b>" = $\lim_{x\to 0^+}
\frac1x$ = $\infty$ and "<b>\lim_{x \to 0^-} 1/x</b>" = $\lim_{x\to 0^-} \frac1x$ = $-\infty$. Addition and explicit multiplication terminate a limit
expression. Limits may also be entered using the standard SymPy syntax "<b>Limit (expression, variable, to)</b>", this defaults to limit from positive
direction like in SymPy, or you may specify a direction "<b>Limit (expression, variable, to, dir='+-')</b>".
</p>

<h3>Sums</h3>

<p>
The summation (finite or infinite) of expression "<b>z</b>" as variable "<b>n</b>" ranges from "<b>a</b>" to "<b>b</b>" is written as "<b>\sum_{n=a}^b
(z)</b>" = $\sum_{n=a}^b (z)$. Iterated sums work as expected, "<b>\sum_{n=1}^3 \sum_{m=1}^n m</b>" = $\sum_{n=1}^3 \sum_{m=1}^n m$ = 10. Addition and
explicit multiplication terminate a sum expression.
Sums may also be entered using the standard SymPy syntax "<b>Sum (expression, (variable, from, to))</b>".
</p>

<h3>Differentiation</h3>

<p>
The derivative of expression "<b>z</b>" with respect to "<b>x</b>" is entered as "<b>d/dx z</b>" or "<b>\frac{d}{dx} z</b>" = $\frac{d}{dx} z$. The
second derivative is "<b>d^2/dx^2 (z)</b>" or "<b>\frac{d^2}{dx^2} (z)</b>" = $\frac{d^2}{dx^2} (z)$. Using "<b>\partial</b>" ($\partial$) is allowed but
must be consistent within the expression. Mixed derivatives are entered as "<b>d^2/dxdy (z)</b>" or "<b>\partial^2 / \partial x\partial y (z)</b>" =
$\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x\partial y} (z)$. Derivatives may also be entered using the standard SymPy syntax "<b>Derivative (expression, var1, var2,
power2, ...)</b>".
</p>

<h3>Integration</h3>

<p>
The anti-derivative of expression "<b>z</b>" with respect to x is written as "<b>\int z dx</b>" = $\int z\ dx$. The definite integral from "<b>a</b>" to
"<b>b</b>" is "<b>\int_a^b z dx</b>" = $\int_a^b z\ dx$. "<b>\int dx/x</b>" = $\int \frac1x\ dx$. Iterated and improper integrals also work. Integrals
may also be entered using the standard SymPy syntax "<b>Integral (expression, (variable, from, to))</b>".
</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>
Due to mixing operators from Python and LaTeX the grammar may be a little wonky in places, so if something doesn't seem to work as it should try wrapping
it in parentheses or putting a space between the problematic elements.
</p><p>
There are many SymPy objects which SymPad does not understand natively yet. In any case where such an object is the result of an evalutation then the
SymPy LaTeX representation will be used for the displayed answer and the SymPy str version of the object will be used as the Python string. This may or
may not allow you to paste the Python string back into SymPad to continue working with the result, you will probably meed to "<b>$</b>" escape function
and object names. <i>simple copy will let you know</i>
