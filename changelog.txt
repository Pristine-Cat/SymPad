* Added definition of lambdas via assignment to undefined function - f(x) = x**2.
* Modified undefined functions to be specifiable implicitly without '?' in most contexts.

v1.0.10:
-----
* Added undefined function initial conditions - ?y(x)(0) = something, ?y(x)'(0) = something
* Added implicit undefined functions - y(x) -> ?y(x)

v1.0.9:
-------
* Added undefined functions (for ODEs).
* Added prime ' differentiation operator.
* Added semicolon separator to allow multiple expressions on single line.
* Cleaned up internal negative object parsing and printing rules.
* Fixed internal lambda variable representation so lambda defined variables doesn't get remapped.

v1.0.8:
-------
* Added extended comparisons: x < y < z >= w != ...
* Added SymPy set operation Contains usage.
* Added and expanded some function visual translations: summation(), .limit(), .diff(), .integrate() and more...

* Fixed more obscure grammar cases.

v1.0.7:
-------
* Added Pythonic 'or', 'and' and 'not' operators using SymPy Or, And and Not.

v1.0.3:
-------
* Extended post-evaluation simplification into basic Python containers.
* dict_keys, dict_values and dict_items converted to lists.
* Autocompletion of parentheses of member function calls and user lambdas.
* Added Subs() and .subs() translation and latex parsing.
