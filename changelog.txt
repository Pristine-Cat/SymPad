v1.0.9:
-------
* Added undefined functions.
* Added prime "'" differentiation operator.
* Changed internal negative object parsing and printing rules.
* Fixed internal lambda variable representation so lambda var specification doesn't get remapped.

v1.0.8:
-------
* Added extended comparisons: x < y < z >= w != ...
* Added SymPy set operation Contains usage.
* Added and expanded some function visual translations: summation(), .limit()/.diff()/.integrate() and more...
* Added compacting of multiple Subs() and .subs().
* Changed lambdas to bind global variables on definition.
* Cleaned up passing assignments as equations into functions.
* Cleaned up internal handling of incomplete and empty matrices.
* Fixed more obscure grammar cases.

v1.0.7:
-------
* Added Pythonic 'or', 'and' and 'not' operators using SymPy Or, And and Not.
* Added slice() translation and lots of slice formatting fixes.
* Changed comparisons to use SymPy comparison objects first and fall back to Python operators if that fails.
* Patched in basic math operation on SymPy Booleans, x + (y > z) valid now.
* Patched SymPy sets.Complement to sympify args.
* Fixed lots of obscure corner case grammar things that should never happen anyway like dictionaries of slices.

v1.0.6:
-------
* Added walk over vector field plotting using matplotlib.

v1.0.5:
-------
* Added vector field plotting using matplotlib.

v1.0.4:
-------
* Added basic function plotting using matplotlib.

v1.0.3:
-------
* Extended post-evaluation simplification into basic Python containers.
* dict_keys, dict_values and dict_items converted to lists.
* Autocompletion of parentheses of member function calls and user lambdas.
* Added Subs() and .subs() translation and latex parsing.

v1.0.2:
-------
* Changed function keyword argument recognition to be more friendly to equations.
* Added automatic post-evaluation simplification (optional through env).
* Added SymPy matrix multiplication intermediate simplification patch to control matrix expression blowup (optional through env).
* Union of symmetric Complement sets converted back to symmetric difference after evaluation where applicable.

v1.0.1:
-------
* Changed native vector and matrix representation from {} to \[] to make grammatical room for sets and dictionaries.
* Added basic sets and operations.
* Added Python dictionaries.
* Added LaTeX \Re and \Im functions and translation.
* Integral now concatenates iterated integrals into one function call.
